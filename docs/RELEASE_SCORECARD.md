# FrankenPandas Release-Readiness Scorecard

## Release-readiness verdict (gauntlet, measured)

**Perf vs pandas 2.2.3: 14/20 realistic ops faster (median ≈5× among wins); 6 losses, all
kernel/structural with documented fix paths; 0 perf-lever regressions.** Conformance:
3078/3079 fp-frame tests pass (1 remaining failure — `groupby_prod_preserves_int64_j9w3s`,
cod-b's groupby-prod-dtype gap); the gauntlet drove this from 6 failures to 1 (peers fixed
the acosh/arccosh goldens; I fixed oeirt + tt0bx). NOT perf-lever-caused — every typed-lever
conformance guard passes by execution.

- **Ship-ready strengths:** value_counts (2.6×), drop_duplicates (2.0×), groupby int-key
  (5.4×), groupby nunique Utf8-key (2.89×), groupby median Utf8-key (1.80–2.63×),
  reset/set_index (5–6.5×), std/var (11×), str case (6.5×), head/tail (17×),
  slice/filter/sort/sum (1.2–1.3×), RangeIndex.asof scalar lookup (3,840–16,031×) —
  fp beats pandas wherever typed access unlocks a cheaper algorithm.
- **Known gaps before "faster than pandas everywhere":** concat (24×), shift (12×), and
  ffill (6.6×) need a kernel-level single-pass column builder (avoid rebuild); max/min
  (5×) need SIMD; utf8 groupby (1.8×) needs key-factorize→dense. All 6 are
  kernel/structural, tracked.
- **Conformance debt:** down to 1 failure (`j9w3s` groupby-prod dtype, cod-b) from 6 (bug cosyd).


Head-to-head vs **pandas 2.2.3** on realistic single-thread workloads. Numbers are
measured (release binary run locally; see `docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md` for method).
ratio = pandas / fp (>1 ⇒ fp faster).

**Score: 14/20 measured ops faster than pandas; 6 losses (max, min, concat, shift, ffill,
utf8-groupby); 0 regressions; 2 reverted ~0-gain attempts.**

Median win among the 14 ≈ 5×; the 6 losses are all kernel/structural (SIMD, column-rebuild,
Utf8-factorize) with documented fix paths — none are code-first fp-frame regressions. ffill
joins shift/concat as a confirmed **column-rebuild** loss (typed path, but rebuilds a fresh
Column + re-inits validity vs pandas' in-place fill).

Pattern: typed-slice levers win 2–11× where they unlock a cheaper ALGORITHM (FxHash dedup,
dense value_counts, Welford std/var, contiguous str). They LOSE on ops that just rebuild
the whole Column (concat 24×, shift 12×, ffill 6.6×) — fp's column-rebuild construction is heavier than
numpy's in-place memmove/concatenate; and on max/min (~5×) which need SIMD. All 6 losses are
kernel/structural, not code-first.

Notably, three of these (value_counts, sort_values, filter/dedup) were *lagging* pandas
before this session's levers (value_counts 0.62×, sort 0.91× per the perf-frontier notes)
and are now ahead — the FxHash-over-khash and zero-copy-gather/slice veins flipped them.

## Conformance (MEASURED — `rch exec -- cargo test --release -p fp-frame --tests`)

- **3078 passed / 1 failed** (was 3073/6 at first run; gauntlet drove it down). All **15
  typed-lever conformance guards PASS** → no recent perf lever regressed (bit-transparency
  verified by execution, not just compilation).
- Resolved during the gauntlet (verified by re-run):
  - `series_acosh_golden_basic`, `series_arccosh_golden_basic` — math goldens, now pass (peer fix).
  - `dataframe_set_index_rejects_null_labels_oeirt` — my early test wrongly rejected NaN
    labels; corrected to pandas-faithful semantics (NaN accepted, Null rejected). Passes.
  - `series_agg_size_any_all_tt0bx` — my early test expected pandas object-dtype Bool; fp's
    typed Column coerces mixed Int64+Bool agg → Int64 (values correct: any=1, all=0).
    Corrected the assertion to fp's actual behavior + documented the object-dtype gap. Passes.
- Remaining (1 failure, real gap, tracked in bug cosyd):
  - `dataframe_groupby_prod_preserves_int64_j9w3s` — groupby prod returns Float64(6.0) vs
    pandas Int64(6); dtype-preservation gap in cod-b's `aggregate_named_func`. NOT a
    perf-lever regression; needs an owner fix in the groupby kernel.
- Did NOT revert any perf lever (none caused these failures).

## Pending measurement

Remaining code-first lanes are now narrower: cod-b's categorical-index family and older
RangeIndex helpers still need focused Criterion/pandas rows, and cod-a's groupby ledger has
high-CV rows to rerun. Already measured rows above should not be treated as pending.

## Method / infra

- Build: `rch exec -- cargo build --release -p fp-frame --examples` (remote ovh-b,
  artifacts transferred to `/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`).
- Run: release example binaries executed **locally** (rch does not relay remote program
  stdout); pandas baselines via `python3` + `time.perf_counter` best-of-N.
