# FrankenPandas Perf — Negative-Evidence Ledger & Head-to-Head vs pandas

Measured head-to-head: each lever's realistic-workload bench run **locally** from the
release binary (built remotely via `rch exec -- cargo build --release -p fp-frame
--examples`, artifacts transferred to `/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`),
compared against **pandas 2.2.3** (`python3`, `time.perf_counter`, best-of-N).

Method: `examples/bench_*.rs` self-time `best=<ns>` over N iters; pandas scripts
(`perf/pandas_baseline/`) time the equivalent op best-of-N on a matched workload.
`ratio = pandas_ns / fp_ns` (>1 ⇒ fp faster). Same machine, single-thread unless noted.

Rule: record EVERY result (win/loss/neutral). Revert any lever that regressed or showed
~0 gain. Never retry a recorded dead end.

## Results

| loc_bool filter (t0y8n) | 2M, 50% mask | 10.89 ms | 8.42 ms | **1.29× faster** | ✅ KEEP — collect-positions + take_positions |
| drop_duplicates FxHashSet (6vep3) | 1M, card 1000 | 5.99 ms | 2.95 ms | **2.03× faster** | ✅ KEEP — beat khash dedup |

| std / var typed (0xdfx Welford) | 2M int64 | 19.5 ms | 1.72 ms | **11.3× faster** | ✅ KEEP — Welford crushes pandas std |
| max typed Int64 (4qs3h) | 2M int64 | 219 µs | 1.15 ms | **0.19× (5.2× SLOWER)** | ⚠️ KEEP (beats old fp Scalar path) but LOSES to numpy SIMD — gap |
| min typed Int64 (4qs3h) | 2M int64 | 230 µs | 1.17 ms | **0.20× (5.1× SLOWER)** | ⚠️ KEEP but LOSES to numpy SIMD — gap |

| reset_index typed Int64 idx→col (bp6k7) | 1M int64-indexed, 2 cols | 1.93 ms | 0.38 ms | **5.1× faster** | ✅ KEEP — Index::from_i64_values |
| concat typed buffer (tbrtu) | 8×125k Int64 series, ignore_index | 0.28 ms | 6.81 ms | **0.041× (24× SLOWER)** | ⚠️ KEEP (bit-transparent, ≥ old Scalar path) but BIG LOSS vs pandas |

### Gap: concat 24× slower than pandas (biggest gap found)
pandas `pd.concat` of Int64 series ≈ a single `np.concatenate` (flat int64 memcpy, 281µs/1M).
fp's path has structural overhead: per-series `as_i64_slice` (may materialize the typed
buffer from the Scalars variant on first call), `extend_from_slice` into a fresh Vec<i64>,
`Column::from_i64_values` (validity init), then `Series::new`. The typed lever is NOT a
regression (≥ the old Scalar concat, bit-transparent) so not reverted, but concat is fp's
weakest realistic op. FIX (future, structural — not a 1-line code-first change): pre-size +
single typed buffer build, avoid double as_i64_slice, ensure from_values yields a
typed-backed column so as_i64_slice is a cheap ref. Recorded as the top perf gap.

### Gap: max/min lose to numpy SIMD (~5×)
fp `Series.max/min` use `iter().max()` (Option/Ord comparison loop, doesn't auto-vectorize)
vs numpy's SIMD max. NOT a regression (the typed lever beats old fp's Scalar iteration), so
not reverted — but a real vs-pandas gap. FIX ATTEMPT (REVERTED): branchless
`fold(i64::MIN, i64::max)` — built+measured, **max stayed 1.15 ms (~0 gain)**; LLVM did not
auto-vectorize the i64 min/max reduction here. Reverted to the simpler `iter().max()`
(working-tree only, never committed). CONCLUSION: beating numpy SIMD max/min needs explicit
SIMD (portable_simd / chunked manual vectorization) — out of safe-Rust auto-vec reach; a
candidate radical lever for the kernel layer, NOT a code-first fp-frame change. Dead end
recorded — do not retry the branchless-fold approach.

## pandas 2.2.3 baselines (best-of-N, for pending comparisons)

| op | workload | pandas best |
|---|---|---:|
| sort_values | 1M shuffled int64 | 57.2 ms |
| head(5) | 2M int64 | 5.9 µs |
| tail(5) | 2M int64 | 5.9 µs |

(fp numbers for these pending the all-examples release build; rows added as measured.)

## Notes / gotchas

- rch executes **remotely** (ovh-b); `cargo run` does NOT relay the program's stdout, so
  build via rch (artifacts transfer back) then run the binary **locally** for timing.
- Release build of fp-frame is ~5 min remote; subsequent example builds reuse the cached lib.
