# FrankenPandas Perf — Negative-Evidence Ledger & Head-to-Head vs pandas

Measured head-to-head: each lever's realistic-workload bench run **locally** from the
release binary (built remotely via `rch exec -- cargo build --release -p fp-frame
--examples`, artifacts transferred to `/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`),
compared against **pandas 2.2.3** (`python3`, `time.perf_counter`, best-of-N).

Method: `examples/bench_*.rs` self-time `best=<ns>` over N iters; pandas scripts
(`perf/pandas_baseline/`) time the equivalent op best-of-N on a matched workload.
`ratio = pandas_ns / fp_ns` (>1 ⇒ fp faster). Same machine, single-thread unless noted.

Rule: record EVERY result (win/loss/neutral). Revert any lever that regressed or showed
~0 gain. Never retry a recorded dead end.

### Gap: Utf8 groupby 1.78× slower than pandas
fp groups Utf8 keys via `build_groups` → `FxHashMap<ScalarKey, Vec<usize>>`: per-row String
hashing + `ScalarKey::Utf8` (holds a `&str`/owned), Vec<usize> accumulation, then agg. The
FxHash lever (buguz) beat SipHash but the path still loses to pandas' factorize-then-aggregate
on object keys. Not a regression (kept). FIX: factorize Utf8 keys to dense codes once (like
the Int64 dense path), then group on codes — a bigger algorithmic change, cod-b's groupby
domain. Int64-key groupby already wins 5.4× via the dense path.

### Gap: shift/concat structural — column-rebuild vs in-place (10–24× slower)
fp shift/concat rebuild a whole new typed Column (`as_f64/i64_slice` materializes the typed
buffer for `from_values`-built columns, then `from_f64/i64_values` re-inits validity, then
`Series::new`) — multiple O(n) passes — whereas pandas shift/concat is ~one numpy memmove/
concatenate. The typed levers are NOT regressions (≥ old fp Scalar rebuild) so kept, but the
WHOLE-COLUMN-REBUILD construction is fp's structural disadvantage on these ops. INSIGHT: the
typed-slice levers win big when typed access unlocks a cheaper ALGORITHM (FxHash dedup, dense
value_counts, Welford std → 2–11× wins) but only break even (then lose on construction
overhead) for ops that merely rebuild the column (shift/concat). Kernel-level fix needed.

### Gap: concat 24× slower than pandas (biggest gap found)
pandas `pd.concat` of Int64 series ≈ a single `np.concatenate` (flat int64 memcpy, 281µs/1M).
fp's path has structural overhead: per-series `as_i64_slice` (may materialize the typed
buffer from the Scalars variant on first call), `extend_from_slice` into a fresh Vec<i64>,
`Column::from_i64_values` (validity init), then `Series::new`. The typed lever is NOT a
regression (≥ the old Scalar concat, bit-transparent) so not reverted, but concat is fp's
weakest realistic op. FIX ATTEMPT (REVERTED): collect each typed slice ONCE via `Option::collect` instead of the
double `as_i64_slice` (probe + extend). Built+measured: **6.81 → 6.49 ms (~5%, immaterial)**
— the double-call was NOT the bottleneck. Reverted (working-tree only). CONFIRMED the 24×
gap is STRUCTURAL: `Column::from_i64_values` (validity init) + `Series::new` + per-series
typed-buffer materialization, vs pandas' single flat `np.concatenate`. Closing it needs a
kernel-level concat (build one validity-free typed Column directly, skip Series wrapping) —
out of code-first fp-frame scope. Dead ends recorded: don't retry double-call dedup.

### Gap: max/min lose to numpy SIMD (~5×)
fp `Series.max/min` use `iter().max()` (Option/Ord comparison loop, doesn't auto-vectorize)
vs numpy's SIMD max. NOT a regression (the typed lever beats old fp's Scalar iteration), so
not reverted — but a real vs-pandas gap. FIX ATTEMPT (REVERTED): branchless
`fold(i64::MIN, i64::max)` — built+measured, **max stayed 1.15 ms (~0 gain)**; LLVM did not
auto-vectorize the i64 min/max reduction here. Reverted to the simpler `iter().max()`
(working-tree only, never committed). CONCLUSION: beating numpy SIMD max/min needs explicit
SIMD (portable_simd / chunked manual vectorization) — out of safe-Rust auto-vec reach; a
candidate radical lever for the kernel layer, NOT a code-first fp-frame change. Dead end
recorded — do not retry the branchless-fold approach.

## Notes / gotchas

- rch executes **remotely** (ovh-b); `cargo run` does NOT relay the program's stdout, so
  build via rch (artifacts transfer back) then run the binary **locally** for timing.
- Release build of fp-frame is ~5 min remote; subsequent example builds reuse the cached lib.
