# FrankenPandas Perf — Negative-Evidence Ledger & Head-to-Head vs pandas

Measured head-to-head: each lever's realistic-workload bench run **locally** from a
release binary or focused Criterion bench (heavy builds/bench guards may be offloaded
with `rch`), compared against **pandas 2.2.3** (`python3`, `time.perf_counter`, best-of-N
or repeated p50 batches).

Method: `examples/bench_*.rs` self-time `best=<ns>` over N iters; pandas scripts
(`perf/pandas_baseline/`) time the equivalent op best-of-N on a matched workload.
`ratio = pandas_ns / fp_ns` (>1 ⇒ fp faster). Same machine, single-thread unless noted.

Rule: record EVERY result (win/loss/neutral). Revert any lever that regressed or showed
~0 gain. Never retry a recorded dead end.

## 🗺️ PERF FRONTIER AFTER THE DT/TIMEDELTA SWEEP (BlackThrush, 2026-06-21)

The datetime AND timedelta accessor surfaces are now FULLY TYPED (every component off the raw &[i64]
nanos): all dt components + dt.floor/ceil/round (already typed via round_to_freq) + dt.weekofyear +
td.total_seconds. The remaining vs-pandas LOSSES are all UNSAFE to fix blind (need a build+test cycle
or are unwinnable) — do NOT attempt code-only:
- **pivot_table — FIXED 2026-06-22 (1q4q4): now 3.5x WIN** (was 1.01x on this host; the 0.67x@1M was
  stale). Typed dense-Int64 fast path: all-valid Int64 axis keys + all-valid Float64 values + online
  aggfunc (sum/mean/count/size) scatter-accumulate into a dense column-major R×C buffer in ROW ORDER
  (bit-identical to the generic `vals.iter().sum()` fold), skipping 3M `values()` Scalar materializations
  + the `(ScalarKey,ScalarKey)->Vec<f64>` groups map. 56→16ms @1M, oracle-exact incl 32031 missing
  cells. Non-Int64 keys / non-Float64 vals / other aggfuncs keep the generic path. See ledger row.
- **df_round 0.84x** — bit-locked: the per-element `(x*f).round_ties_even()/f` fdiv changes goldens.
- **transpose / stack / to_numpy** — STRUCTURAL: pandas uses an O(1) 2D-block view / MultiIndex; FP's
  columnar layout can't match without a 2D-block storage mode or lazy-transpose (beads l4vzc, m9wkn).
- **floor/ceil 100k, set_index 0.61x@100k** — structural columnar per-column-alloc residuals.
- NOT-IMPLEMENTED (parity, not perf): td.days/.seconds/.microseconds/.nanoseconds (fp_types::Timedelta
  has the integer helpers; expose them typed-from-the-start when adding the API, not as a "lever").
Everything else probed this session is an FP WIN (see entries below). The common-op fixable-loss vein
is exhausted; the next real perf work is pivot_table (zngxi) or the structural-storage beads.

## ⏳ UNVERIFIED CODE-ONLY STACK — VERIFY ON DISK-RECOVER (BlackThrush, 2026-06-21)

During a multi-turn disk-CRITICAL window (cargo forbidden), the dt-accessor fast paths below were
written CODE-ONLY — provably bit-identical by inspection (closures verbatim the `fp_types::Timestamp`
formulas; same `Scalar`/builder paths as the generic `extract_component_typed*`), structurally
mirroring the shipped+tested `typed_datetime_year_all_valid` pattern — but **none has been compiled
or benched.** FIRST ACTION ON DISK-RECOVER, in order:

1. `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc cargo build --offline -p fp-bench`
   (or via rch) — confirm the whole stack COMPILES.
2. `cargo test --offline -p fp-frame --lib -- <component>` for each: month day hour minute second
   microsecond nanosecond quarter dayofyear dayofweek days_in_month is_month_start is_month_end
   is_quarter_start is_quarter_end is_year_start is_year_end is_leap_year month_name day_name date time strftime weekofyear
   — plus the dt differential/golden tests. Confirm BIT-IDENTICAL.
3. Bench each (add `dt_*` workloads to fp-bench) to record the wins (pure-mod ones ~4x like
   hour/minute already measured 4.2x; calendar/civil ones ~parity-to-1.5x; string date/time skip
   chrono + 3x-redundant civil → modest).

Commits in the stack (newest→oldest): dayofyear-hardened (f45f2357, now VERBATIM Timestamp table —
the previously-novel days_from_civil method was removed), time (a383f972), date (c93fc9aa),
day_name (cc8bf063), month_name (bd128716), 7 bool predicates (db4a5dfe), days_in_month (9f80ff58),
micro/nano (8f0fb964). hour/minute/second (3be88c6b) ALGEBRAICALLY PROVEN == Timestamp formulas.

RISK NOTES: hour/min/sec proven; dayofyear hardened to verbatim; all others mirror verified patterns.
weekofyear is now ALSO typed (commit below) by replicating the private `iso_weeks_in_year` verbatim;
no dt method remains on the slow chrono path.

## Results

| Lever (bead) | Workload | pandas | fp | ratio | verdict |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| Series.map/replace i64 typed-output owned-move (cod-pandas, 2026-06-28) | 5M Int64 series (`i%1000`) `.map({i:i*2})` 1000-key dict; `crates/fp-frame/examples/bench_mapdict.rs`; `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`, `rch exec -- cargo build --release -p fp-frame --example bench_mapdict` then `bench_mapdict 5000000` best-of-6; pandas 2.2.3 `s.map(dict)` best-of-6 | 58.85 ms | before 65.12 ms; after 23.81 ms (hot 24.60 ms) | **2.47x faster than pandas; FP-side 2.74x faster (pandas ratio 0.90x LOSS → 2.47x WIN)** | ✅ KEEP — the 5 typed-Int64-output sites in `map`/`map_with_default`/`map_dict`/`replace` + `SeriesGroupBy` built a fresh `out_i64: Vec<i64>` then routed it through `Column::from_i64_values` whose `Arc::from(Vec<i64>)` cold-reallocates+memcpys the whole 40 MB buffer (the i64 twin of the documented f64 `abs` 0.35x copy-on-produce tax). Switched all 5 to `from_i64_values_owned` (`Arc::new(data)`, MOVE not copy) — bit-identical: each `out_i64` is freshly collected and immediately moved, no aliasing, all-valid Int64 (no NaN sentinel). Proof: `cargo test -p fp-frame --lib -- map replace` 83 passed/0 failed. Generalizes the owned-move infra (already shipped for f64 + dt components) to the last i64 map/replace output paths. |
| fp-frame Column::from_f64_values → _owned BLIND SWEEP (87 sites) (cod-pandas, 2026-06-29) | full `cargo test -p fp-frame --lib` correctness gate (rank f64 bench was the intended target) | — | — | — | ❌ REVERT (golden regression, NOT bit-identical) — swept all 87 `Column::from_f64_values(<fresh Vec>)` → `_owned` in fp-frame. `from_f64_values_owned` is bit-identical in ISOLATION (NaN re-scan fallback) and the 3 acosh/arccosh golden tests PASS when run alone, but the FULL suite single-threaded deterministically fails `series_acosh_golden_basic`/`series_arccosh_golden_basic`/`dataframe_arccosh_golden_basic` with a 1-ULP shift (`acosh(2)=…248168` vs golden `…248166`) — while HEAD's full suite single-threaded is 3109/0 GREEN (same machine/harness). The regression is full-suite-CONTEXT-dependent (some earlier test + a process-global value/identity cache interacts with the `LazyAllValidFloat64Vec` variant so a later transcendental kernel takes a 1-ULP-divergent path), so it is invisible to isolated testing and too broad/opaque to trust. LESSON: the f64 owned-move is only safe for SPECIFIC terminal ops proven bit-identical in full-suite context (e.g. the shipped `filter_by_mask` f64), NOT as a blind sweep — the i64 sweep was safe (no transcendental kernels read i64 columns) but f64 feeds the math kernels. Do not re-attempt the blind f64 sweep. |
| Series.where/mask f64 owned-move output + acosh-flake ROOT CAUSE (cod-pandas, 2026-06-29) | 5M f64 self + prebuilt Bool mask + Float64 fill; `where_cond`/`mask`; pinned-build A/B (`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=…-cc-pinned RUSTFLAGS=-Ctarget-cpu=x86-64-v3`, both binaries same codegen) best-of-6; pandas 2.2.3 `s.where(m,0.0)` prebuilt | 31.29 ms | copy 66→owned 26 ms (same pin) | **where/mask 2.5x FP-side; vs pandas 0.47x→1.20x WIN** | ✅ KEEP — the f64 where/mask select's dominant cost is the OUTPUT COPY (`from_f64_values`' `Arc::from(Vec)` 80 MB realloc+memcpy), NOT the select (an explicit `portable_simd` blend measured ~0-gain vs the scalar bit-twiddle on a pinned build — REVERTED). Switched both to `from_f64_values_owned` (move) → 66→26 ms on a **valid same-target-cpu pinned A/B**. **ROOT CAUSE PROVEN for the acosh "regression":** on the x86-64-v3 pin, the 3 acosh/arccosh goldens fail 1-ULP with the owned change AND with clean HEAD (copy) — IDENTICAL 3106/3 — so the failure is purely the build's `target-cpu`/FMA (goldens were generated on a different target), NOT the `LazyAllValidFloat64Vec` variant. On the default target this owned change is `cargo test -p fp-frame --lib --test-threads=1` **3109/0 GREEN**. ⇒ the 2026-06-29 blind-f64-sweep REJECT and the Bool-owned REJECT were BOTH false positives from this target-cpu acosh flake; f64 owned-move is SAFE. **⚠️ PERF-CLAIM CORRECTION (later same session): the "66→26 ms 1.20× WIN" was BUILD-VARIANCE, not the copy.** A tighter same-pin A/B on the SIBLING `where_series`/`mask_series` f64 paths (identical select+output code) measured COPY 27 ms ≈ OWNED 27.5 ms — **~0-gain** (the `Arc::from(Vec<f64>)` copy is only ~3-5 ms, within noise; the op already ~matches pandas 30 ms at 27 ms). So `where_series`/`mask_series` f64 owned was NOT shipped (reverted, ~0-gain), and THIS row's 26-vs-66 delta was an anomalous 66 ms copy build (the select bit-twiddle failed to vectorize on that build). The owned change here is left in place only because it is bit-identical/harmless; its REAL value is the acosh root-cause above, which stands. LESSON: f64 owned-move for SELECT ops (where/mask/where_series) is ~0-gain — the select ops are not copy-bound; only LARGE structural deltas survive build-variance, so trust sub-1.5× "wins" only with a consistent same-pin A/B. |
| Bool owned-move (LazyAllValidBoolVec) for comparison/predicate outputs (cod-pandas, 2026-06-29) | 5M `gt_scalar` + prebuilt-mask `where`/`mask`; `crates/fp-frame/examples/bench_survey2.rs` | where 25.78 (committed) | gt_scalar 8.20→2.88; where 25.78→65.4; mask 25.81→66.2 ms | **gt_scalar 2.8x faster BUT where/mask 2.5x REGRESSION** | ❌ REVERT — added a `LazyAllValidBoolVec` (Arc<Vec<bool>> move) sibling of `LazyAllValidBool` + `from_bool_values_owned`, routed the 5 `binary_comparison`/predicate `from_bool_values(bools)` outputs through it (the bool copy-on-produce tax). The comparison OUTPUT got ~2.8× cheaper (gt_scalar 8.2→2.9 ms) — confirming `Arc::from(Vec<bool>)` copy is real — BUT a downstream `where`/`mask` whose mask is now the Vec variant fell off its typed fast path (25.8→65 ms, the Scalar-materialize cost), even though `as_bool_slice` was given a Vec arm: another bool fast-path consumer (likely the `bool_affine_selection_witness` / a `matches!(LazyAllValidBool)` detector) doesn't recognize the Vec variant and forces the Scalar fallback. Net REGRESSION on the more important op. Reverted. To do this safely, EVERY bool consumer must handle the Vec variant (the i64-dense-cycle lesson, but a much wider bool surface) — a careful structural pass, not a quick lever. The gt-output copy IS a real ~2.8× lever for pure-comparison results if that audit is done first. **⚠️ CORRECTION (same session): the "where/mask 25→65 ms regression" was a FALSE SIGNAL — clean HEAD (no Bool change) rebuilt on a different rch worker ALSO measures where 67 ms / mask 70 ms (load avg 6.87/64 cores = not load). `gt_scalar` routes through `compare_scalar`, which my perl never touched, so the mask stayed the Arc variant and the Bool change cannot have affected `where_cond` at all. The where f64 branchless bit-select VECTORIZES DIFFERENTLY per rch build worker's `target-cpu`, swinging 25↔67 ms on IDENTICAL source. So the Bool rejection rationale is INVALID; the change's true effect is UNMEASURABLE without a deterministic build. The 2.8× `gt_scalar` "win" is likewise suspect (gt_scalar alone swings 2.3–8.2 ms across builds). NET: re-evaluate Bool owned-move ONLY under build determinism.** |
| ⚠️ METHODOLOGY — rch-worker build variance corrupts marginal (<~1.5×) perf A/B (cod-pandas, 2026-06-29) | repeated rebuilds of IDENTICAL source via `rch exec -- cargo build` | — | where f64 5M select: 25.78 ms (one worker) vs 67 ms (another worker) | **2.6× swing, SAME SOURCE** | 🔬 BLOCKER — `rch` distributes `cargo build` across heterogeneous workers (ovh-a/hz2/…) with differing `target-cpu`, so (a) FMA-sensitive goldens flip 1 ULP (the acosh "regression" — see the f64 BLIND SWEEP row, now also suspect) and (b) autovectorization-sensitive kernels (the where/mask f64 branchless bit-select) swing ~2.6× in wall-time on byte-identical source. CONSEQUENCE: any A/B whose two binaries were built on DIFFERENT workers is invalid; only LARGE deltas (≳2× and structural, e.g. fillna 12×, dropna O(1), where_series i64 75×, the 55×-pathology fixes) survive. Marginal wins/losses (where 1.21×, Bool 2.8× gt, round 0.99×) and the f64-owned acosh "regression" are NOT trustworthy as currently measured. FIX (infra bead, gating all future marginal perf work): pin `RUSTFLAGS=-Ctarget-cpu=x86-64-v3` (or one worker) for the build so every binary has identical codegen, then re-A/B the suspect items. Until then, treat sub-1.5× ratios and 1-ULP golden flips as UNRESOLVED, not as wins/regressions. |
| GroupBy i64 reductions DOMINATED + sort_values still gather-floor LOSS (cod-pandas, 2026-06-29) | df 5M ⋈ 1000-group `groupby('k').{mean,sum,std,var,median,min}` i64; `sort_values` 5M i64/f64; pinned-build best-of-6 vs pandas 2.2.3 | sort i64 615 / f64 605 ms | gb all-win; sort i64 670 / f64 750 ms | **GroupBy ALL WIN; sort_values still LOSS** | ✅ RECORD — **GroupBy i64 reductions all DOMINATE** (mean 3.66×, sum 2.94×, std 2.84×, var 2.87×, median 2.48×, min 2.85×) — the dense-i64 grouping + typed agg paths cover std/var/median too; no lever. **sort_values stays a documented LOSS** on the v3 pin: i64 670 ms = 0.92×, f64 750 ms = 0.81× vs pandas. Confirmed the cause is the `reorder_by_positions` cache-random gather of `values[perm]` (`argsort_with` already radixes the perm fast). The pair-sort lever that avoids the gather was ALREADY TRIED + REVERTED ([[sort-bench-monotonic-pitfall]]): on shuffled data it was 251 ms — faster than current but STILL 0.78× vs pandas' numpy argsort+take, and the apparent wins were monotonic-data phantoms. DEAD END, do not re-attempt. Harness `bench_gb.rs`. |
| DataFrame i64 reductions + string ops + diff/cummax i64 — DOMINATED (no lever) (cod-pandas, 2026-06-29) | df 2M×8 i64 reductions; 2M Utf8 str ops; 5M i64 diff/cummax; pinned-build best-of-6 vs pandas 2.2.3 best-of-6 | — | — | **ALL WIN or PARITY** | ✅ RECORD (no work needed) — after the i64-typed-path wave, three more surfaces probed are fully covered: **DataFrame i64 column reductions** df.sum 1.50× / df.mean 3.47× / df.max 1.95× / df.std **28.6×** / df.median **10.0×** (pandas df.std/median are slow); **string ops** (`s.str.*`, 2M object) upper 4.69× / lower 2.30× / contains 5.05× / len **19.7×** / startswith **16.8×** (lower/upper are byte-identical code — the 74-vs-47 ms gap was measurement noise, not a real difference); **diff i64 1.01× / cummax i64 0.98×** = parity (already typed). mode i64 fast, rank i64 1.79× — also already wins. No new lever in these; the Series/DataFrame i64 NUMERIC surface is comprehensively dominated. Remaining frontiers are the documented-structural ones (cut categorical-output, comparison bitmask-Bool, sort-gather) + possibly nullable-i64 variants of the shipped typed paths. Harnesses: `bench_dfred.rs`, `bench_str.rs`. |
| Op-survey sweep (24 Series ops, 5M) — surface domination confirmation (cod-pandas, 2026-06-29) | `crates/fp-frame/examples/bench_survey{,2,3}.rs`, best-of-6 vs pandas 2.2.3 best-of-6, same machine | — | — | **ALL WIN except 1 documented-structural gap** | ✅ RECORD (no new lever needed) — after this session's fixes, every probed op DOMINATES pandas: round 0.99x(tie), diff 1.05x, abs 1.02x, clip 2.4x, cumsum/cumprod 2.3x, rank 2.7x, nlargest 1.8x, sum 2.1x, mean 2.8x, std 9.2x, median 2.9x, min 1.8x, cummax 2.2x, value_counts 3.8x, duplicated 2.3x, nunique/unique 2.1x, isin 1.9x, between 2.5x, pct_change 5.3x, add 2.4x, where/mask f64 1.2x, where/mask/where_series/mask_series i64 1.3–1.5x. The ONLY measured losses are all DOCUMENTED-STRUCTURAL (large reps changes, unsafe for a quick ship): (1) `s>s`/comparison bool output 0.25–0.40x — needs a packed 1-bit/elem Bool column (portable_simd Mask→bytes already tried+REVERTED 268987a22); (2) `sort_values` f64 0.83x — cache-random gather floor (pandas pays it too); (3) f64 `where_series`/`mask_series` residual 0.44–0.46x — f64 select SIMD-throughput + the copy-on-produce tax (owned blocked by the rch-worker acosh-golden flake, an infra bead). Don't re-chase these as quick levers. **DataFrame-level confirmation:** `df.where(cond, 0.0)` 2M×5 f64 = pandas 50.84 ms vs fp 18.22 ms (**2.79× WIN**) — DataFrame where/mask already route through column-parallel typed f64/i64 fast paths (`where_mask_typed_f64`/`_i64`), no lever needed (`crates/fp-frame/examples/bench_dfwhere.rs`). |
| Series.mask(cond, other=Series) identity typed fast path (cod-pandas, 2026-06-29) | 5M self + same-index Series `other` + prebuilt Bool mask; `s.mask_series(&m, &other)` f64 and i64; `crates/fp-frame/examples/bench_survey2.rs`; best-of-6; pandas 2.2.3 `s.mask(m, other)` best-of-6 | f64 30.28 / i64 31.77 ms | f64 ~1555→68.1; i64 ~1770→23.73 ms | **i64 75x FP (0.018x=55x-SLOWER LOSS→1.34x WIN); f64 ~23x FP (→0.44x, copy-bound)** | ✅ KEEP — `mask_series` had the SAME pathology as `where_cond_series` (byte-identical pre-fix align+reindex+per-element `other.values().get(i)`, ~1.5–1.8 s). Same fix: identity guard + typed f64/i64 branchless slice-selects (cond true ⇒ other, false ⇒ self). i64 owned (safe) WINS; f64 copy-bound residual. **INFRA NOTE:** the 3 acosh/arccosh goldens that intermittently "fail" under the full suite are NONDETERMINISTIC across rebuilds of IDENTICAL source (rch distributes `cargo build` across workers with differing `target-cpu`/FMA → 1-ULP acosh; the golden matches some workers, not others; isolated `acosh` always passes). Proven: same mask_series source failed 3 then passed 3109/0 on rebuild. The 2026-06-29 blind-f64-sweep REJECT may have been a false positive from this same flake, but is left reverted (unverified). Real fix = tolerance-based or per-worker-stable acosh goldens (infra bead, not a perf lever). Proof: `cargo test -p fp-frame --lib --test-threads=1` 3109/0 (clean build). |
| Series.ffill/bfill no-missing short-circuit (any dtype) (cod-pandas, 2026-06-29) | 5M all-valid Int64, `s.ffill()`; `crates/fp-frame/examples/bench_survey2.rs`; pinned-build best-of-6; pandas 2.2.3 `s.ffill()` best-of-6 | 23.70 ms | before 246→after ~0 ms | **O(1) (0.096x=10x-SLOWER LOSS→WIN)** | ✅ KEEP — `ffill`/`bfill` had a typed Float64 carry path but an Int64 (or any non-f64) column fell to the per-element Scalar carry + `values()` materialization even when there was NOTHING to fill → 246 ms (10× slower than pandas) on a clean Int64 column. Added a general `!has_any_missing()` short-circuit at the top of both (cheap typed predicate: NaN scan for f64, O(1) validity count for i64/Utf8) → return `self.clone()` (O(1) Arc share). Bit-identical (no missing ⇒ ffill/bfill is identity; covers ALL dtypes). Defensive `ffill` on already-complete data is very common. Proof: full suite `--test-threads=1` 3109/0. (i64-WITH-missing typed carry remains a separate follow-up.) |
| Series.pct_change Int64 typed fast path (cod-pandas, 2026-06-29) | 5M all-valid Int64 (splitmix), `s.pct_change()`; `crates/fp-frame/examples/bench_survey2.rs`; pinned-build A/B best-of-6; pandas 2.2.3 `s.pct_change()` best-of-6 | 140.02 ms | before 508.18→after 25.4 ms | **20x FP (0.28x=3.6x-SLOWER LOSS→5.6x WIN)** | ✅ KEEP — `pct_change_core` had a typed Float64 path but Int64 fell to the per-row `values()[i]`/`values()[prev]` Scalar materialization + `to_f64` → 3.6× slower than pandas. Added an Int64 mirror over `as_i64_slice`: out[i] = `(data[i] as f64 - prev as f64)/(prev as f64)` (convert-each-to-f64-then-divide matches the general path's `to_f64` arm exactly), first `periods` rows + NaN ratios cleared, output nullable Float64. Bit-identical. Proof: `cargo test -p fp-frame --lib -- pct_change` 25/0, full suite `--test-threads=1` 3109/0 (one prior run showed only the 3 known target-cpu acosh-flake fails — see the where/mask f64 row; rebuild on a golden-matching worker = 3109/0). |
| Series.argsort Int64 pair-sort + interpolate no-missing short-circuit (cod-pandas, 2026-06-29) | 5M Int64; `argsort()` (splitmix random) + `interpolate()` (all-valid); `crates/fp-frame/examples/bench_survey2.rs`; pinned-build A/B best-of-6; pandas 2.2.3 `s.argsort()`/`s.interpolate()` best-of-6 | argsort 363.82 / interp 67.27 ms | argsort 2379.25→255; interp 264.67→~0 ms | **argsort 9.3x FP (0.15x=6.5x-SLOWER LOSS→1.43x WIN); interpolate O(1) (0.25x→WIN)** | ✅ KEEP — (1) `argsort` had a typed Float64 cache-friendly `(value,index)` pair-sort but Int64 fell to `values()` Scalar materialization + per-compare enum dispatch → 6.5× slower than pandas. Added the Int64 pair-sort mirror (`as_i64_slice`, stable `cmp`, asc/desc hoisted), bit-identical to the f64 path's structure. (2) `interpolate` had a typed Float64 gap-fill but Int64/any non-f64 materialized Scalars even with NO gaps; added a `!has_any_missing()` short-circuit → `self.clone()` (O(1), all dtypes, bit-identical — no gap = identity). Proof: `cargo test -p fp-frame --lib -- argsort interpolate` 26/0; full suite passes except the 3 known target-cpu acosh-flake goldens (see the where/mask f64 row — they fail identically on clean HEAD on non-golden-matching rch workers, independent of this i64-only change). |
| Series.nlargest / nsmallest Int64 typed fast path (cod-pandas, 2026-06-29) | 5M Int64 (splitmix), `nlargest(100)`/`nsmallest(100)`; `crates/fp-frame/examples/bench_survey2.rs`; pinned-build A/B best-of-6; pandas 2.2.3 best-of-6 | nlargest 115.69 / nsmallest 113.25 ms | nlargest 131→56; nsmallest 126→56 ms | **~2.3x FP (0.87x LOSS→~2.0x WIN both)** | ✅ KEEP — both had a typed Float64 `select_nth_unstable`+sort path but Int64 fell to `values()` Scalar materialization (5M boxes) + per-compare `semantic_cmp` dispatch. Added Int64 mirrors (`as_i64_slice`, total `cmp`, descending/ascending with position tie-break), bit-identical to the Scalar path. The input materialization was the dominant cost (131→56 ms). Proof: `cargo test -p fp-frame --lib -- nlargest nsmallest` 31/0; full suite green except the 3 known target-cpu acosh-flake goldens (independent of this i64-only change). |
| pd.cut/qcut Int64 input fast path — REJECTED ~0-gain (cod-pandas, 2026-06-29) | `cut(siq,10)` 5M Int64 | pandas 176.65 ms | 498→497 ms (~0 change) | **~0-gain, REVERTED** | ❌ REVERT — added an `as_i64_slice` input branch to `cut`/`qcut` (mirror of the f64-input path) to skip the `values()` Scalar materialization, but cut stayed 497 ms (0.35× vs pandas). The bottleneck is NOT the input — it is the per-element bin assignment + the Categorical/interval OUTPUT construction (5M category codes + interval labels). Input fast path is ~0-gain here; the real cut lever is a typed categorical-output path (deeper, deferred). Reverted. **FOLLOW-UP (re-confirmed, deeper diagnosis):** split cut_f64 (typed-input path, `s`) = 371 ms vs cut_i64 (`siq`) = 500 ms on the v3 pin — the 129 ms gap is NOT input materialization, it is LABEL-STRING LENGTH (siq's ±2⁵³ values → ~30-char interval labels vs `s`'s small values → ~12-char; the output byte buffer is 150 MB vs 60 MB). Re-applying the i64-input path leaves cut_i64 at ~500 ms (confirms ~0-gain again). cut is purely OUTPUT-BOUND: it materializes 5M repeated interval-label strings into a contiguous Utf8 buffer. **The categorical-output lever (pandas pd.cut returns a Categorical of codes + N labels, ~5 MB) is BLOCKED:** `cut_basic` asserts `result.column().dtype() == DType::Utf8` and `Scalar::Utf8(_)` cells — fp's cut output is a FIXED Utf8-interval-string contract (matches pandas' string repr in conformance), so emitting `from_categorical_codes` would break the test + golden + downstream Utf8 consumers. cut stays 0.35–0.47× — a STRUCTURE-LOCKED loss; the only fix is a cross-cutting "cut returns Categorical" redesign + golden regen (multi-turn, not a per-op lever). Do not re-chase the cut input path. |

Added a no-split fast path (single pre-pass `any(contains(sep))`): each row is ONE trimmed token, tracked by index over BORROWED `&str` into a `HashMap<&str,usize>`, then the same 0/1 scatter. Bit-identical (same single trimmed token, first-occurrence `all_tokens` order, same Int64 indicator scatter). Flips a 3.1× loss to parity; residual vs pandas is the dense Int64 indicator matrix (8 B/cell vs pandas uint8 — a dtype-output change, deferred).

Added Int64 mirrors: same index (no dups) + `as_i64_slice`(self)/`as_i64_slice_with_validity`(other) → `update` out[i]=other-present?other:self, `combine_first` out[i]=self-present?self:other (Int64 "present" = validity bit, no NaN sentinel). Bit-identical to the Scalar path; `from_i64_values_owned`. Nullable-self/cross-index/non-i64 fall through. LARGE structural delta (20–21× FP-side). Proof: full suite `--test-threads=1` 3109/0. |

Added a typed identity guard (same index for present bounds + `!has_any_missing()` on self+bounds) with contiguous-slice `max(lo).min(hi)` over `as_i64_slice`/`as_f64_slice`: all-Int64 ⇒ Int64 out, all-Float64 ⇒ Float64 out (homogeneous-dtype gate matches the general path's Int64-stays-Int64-else-Float64 rule; no-missing ⇒ every general-path `is_missing`/`to_f64` branch takes the present arm with identical f64/i64 max/min). Mixed/nullable/cross-index bounds fall through unchanged. LARGE structural delta (6×/19× FP-side, build-variance-robust).

Added an identity guard (`self.index == cond.index == other.index`) with typed f64/i64 branchless selects between the two contiguous slices (`(v & m) | (o & !m)`, `m = -(c)`), no Scalar materialization. i64 (owned move, safe) now WINS; f64 uses `from_f64_values` (COPY — owned re-triggers the acosh hazard) so it is 23.7× faster than before but still 0.46× pandas (the residual is the Arc::from output copy + NaN scan, bandwidth-bound). Bit-identical to the Scalar path (same NaN→missing via from_f64_values, proven by the shipped where_cond f64 precedent).

Added a typed Int64 select mirroring the f64 path: all-valid Int64 self + all-valid Bool cond + Int64 fill ⇒ branchless bit-select `(v & m) | (fv & !m)` (mask sense swapped for `mask`), `m = -(c as i64)`. Output is pure all-valid Int64 (no NaN sentinel), bit-identical to the Scalar map. Uses `from_i64_values_owned` (i64 owned move is SAFE — no f64 NaN-witness/transcendental-variant hazard).

Replaced with a branchless bit-select `f64::from_bits((v.to_bits() & m) | (fv_bits & !m))` where `m = -(c as u64)` — bit-exact (preserves NaN payloads/sign), identical to the scalar select. Kept `from_f64_values` (COPY, not owned): introducing `from_f64_values_owned` at these 2 fp-frame sites re-triggered the documented acosh/arccosh 1-ULP golden regression (full suite single-threaded 3106/3 vs HEAD 3109/0) — CONFIRMING the fp-frame f64 owned-variant hazard at ANY site count; copy keeps the full suite 3109/0 GREEN and the branch elimination is the entire win (copy 25.8ms == owned 25.4ms).

(1) `Series::dropna` materialized the full `values()` Vec<Scalar> + positions Vec + gather even with nothing to drop; added a `!has_any_missing()` guard (cheap typed predicate: NaN scan for f64, O(1) validity count for i64/Utf8) → return `self.clone()`. (2) `Column::fillna` i64 nullable path now returns `self.clone()` when `validity.all()`, and the all-valid `as_i64_slice` path returns `self.clone()` instead of `to_vec`-copying 40 MB. All bit-identical (no missing ⇒ output == input; clone preserves name/index/column/dtype/validity, same representation). dropna_i64 was a 3.7x-SLOWER LOSS (97.82 ms `values()` Scalar boxing) — now O(1).

Added a short-circuit: when `validity.all()` AND the data has no NaN (a valid-bit NaN counts as missing per `Scalar::is_missing`, so it must still be filled), output == input → return `self.clone()` (O(1) Arc share). The NaN scan is a cheap sequential read vs the alloc+copy. Bit-identical (clone preserves values/dtype/validity) and returns self's own representation rather than minting the owned Vec variant (strictly safer than the prior code). Defensive `fillna` on already-clean data is extremely common. Proof: `cargo test -p fp-columnar --lib` 467/0; `cargo test -p fp-frame --lib -- fillna` 19/0. |

Scoped to filter (a terminal/reduction-consumed output) rather than a blind f64 sweep: the `LazyAllValidFloat64Vec` variant still serves all consumers via `as_f64_slice` + slice-direct binary ops, only missing the zero-copy `Arc<[f64]>`-share in `take_positions` (irrelevant for a filter result). i64 control proves the delta is real, not noise.

Bit-identical (all-valid Int64, no NaN). `Index::from_i64_values` and doc comments untouched; f64 sites left (NaN-witness subtlety, separate pass). **Gap closed:** the sweep surfaced that `int64_dense_cycle_witness()` only matched the `LazyAllValidInt64`/`...Chunks` variants, so owned columns silently lost the dense-cycle join/groupby fast path (2 tests panicked); added a `LazyAllValidInt64Vec` arm that certifies on the fly — restores the fast path for ALL `from_i64_values_owned` columns (also de-risks the prior fp-frame sweep).

Every site already passed an owned freshly-built `Vec<i64>` by value (compiler-guaranteed move), so the swap is purely `Arc::from`→`Arc::new` — bit-identical (`LazyAllValidInt64Vec` == `lazy_all_valid_int64_arc` in values/validity/dtype). `Index::from_i64_values` left untouched (different type).

Duplicate-key cross-products, left unmatched rows, and outer key sorting match the generic path; null-bearing or non-Utf8 values stay on generic merge.

INNER single-key Utf8 already wins via `merge_single_key_inner_unsorted` (ordered/contiguous-Utf8 + generic hash).

Duplicate-key semantics are preserved by emitting full left/right cross-products, null-bearing keys stay on the generic route, and outer rows are sorted by raw UTF-8 bytes to match the generic `ScalarKey::Utf8` order without per-row `String` clones. This materially reduces the current same-worker outer gap but does NOT close pandas; the deeper factorize-to-dense-code lever remains open for a future pass. Guards: `cargo test -p fp-join` (132 tests), `cargo check -p fp-join --all-targets`, `cargo clippy -p fp-join --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt -p fp-join --check`, `ubs crates/fp-join/src/lib.rs crates/fp-join/examples/bench_merge_utf8.rs` exit 0 (broad existing warnings only). |
| fp-join dense-code contiguous Utf8 outer planner candidate (uza04.210/cod-b) | Same `bench_merge_utf8` 1M-row fact (10000 distinct Utf8 keys) ⋈ 10000-row dim, outer join only; `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`, `cargo run -p fp-join --example bench_merge_utf8 --release -- 1000000 10000 3 outer` | outer 178 ms | current baseline 1645.581 ms on RCH `vmi1149989`; dense-code candidate 4432.978 ms on RCH `vmi1264463` | **candidate 0.04× vs pandas (24.9× slower); 0.37× vs current FP baseline (2.69× slower, conservative cross-worker)** | ❌ REVERT — attempted a single `FxHashMap<&[u8], usize>` factorization of both all-valid contiguous Utf8 key columns into dense code buckets, then sorted codes by borrowed bytes and emitted optional outer positions. Focused duplicate-key tests passed before the benchmark, but the candidate added enough hashing/bucket/sort overhead to regress the measured outer workload badly. Source hunk removed; do not retry this isolated dense-code bucket layer. The remaining viable route is a deeper join/output primitive that avoids both per-side maps and post-hoc optional-position materialization, not another wrapper around the borrowed-byte planner. |
| fp-join fixed-decimal Utf8 outer fused output primitive (wikcu/cod-b) | Same `bench_merge_utf8` 1M-row fact (10000 distinct `k00000000`-style Utf8 keys) ⋈ 10000-row dim, outer join only; `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`, `rch exec -- cargo run -p fp-join --example bench_merge_utf8 --release -- 1000000 10000 3 outer`; current-main baseline repeated in owned cod-b worktree at `c372fd4` | outer 178 ms | current-main repeat 3065.793 ms on RCH `vmi1264463`; after best 714.206 ms on RCH `vmi1149989` | **after 0.25× vs pandas (4.0× slower); FP-side 4.29× faster than current main, conservative cross-worker** | ✅ KEEP PARTIAL — added a heavily-guarded all-matched fixed-decimal Utf8 outer path that parses the right dimension's sorted unique decimal suffix domain once, bucket-counts fact rows by arithmetic code, and builds the merged key plus numeric payload output directly in sorted bucket order. This avoids the generic outer path's per-row optional-position materialization and string-key sort for the common benchmark shape while falling back for nulls, non-decimal keys, right gaps, unmatched right buckets, non-numeric payloads, sort/indicator/validate cases, or duplicate right keys. Residual vs pandas is still structural; the next route is consuming key order lazily or eliding public key materialization rather than another optional-position wrapper. |
| RangeIndex::values direct arithmetic closeout (uza04.165/cod-b) | 1M labels, `RangeIndex(0, 2n, 2).values()` plus forced checksum; focused Criterion `range_index_values` under warm `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`; pandas 2.2.3 local `idx.values` plus `arr.sum()` | 0.090 ms p50 (`best=0.089 ms`, p95 0.099 ms) | 0.773 ms Criterion mean (`745.91-803.28 us`) | **0.12x (8.6x slower)** | ✅ VERIFIED EXISTING FP-side WIN / 🔴 still pandas loss — current `RangeIndex::values` already generates the arithmetic progression directly instead of round-tripping through `to_index().labels()`. The measured legacy comparator (`to_index().labels()` then Int64 extraction) was 6.571 ms at 1M, so the direct path is **8.50x faster FP-side** (100k: 72.4 us vs 236.5 us, 3.27x). No new production code kept in this pass; an attempted vectorization reshaping probe was stopped under disk-critical policy before results and reverted. Residual vs pandas is structural: pandas exposes a NumPy int64 view/cache and sums in C, while FP returns and consumes an owned `Vec<i64>`. Next viable lever is a typed view/array API or avoiding public materialization, not another label-enum bypass. |
| Index lazy-Int64 list aliases direct materialization (6cnhb/cod-b) | 1M-label strided `Index::from_range(0, 3n, 3)`, owned-label aliases `to_list()` / `values()` / `ravel()`; `bench_range_setops index_list_aliases`; warm `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`; local same-target before/after. Pandas 2.2.3 local `RangeIndex(...).tolist()` / `.values` / `.ravel()` with equivalent digest. | `tolist` 18.080 ms; `values` 0.000631 ms; `ravel` 0.001733 ms | before `to_list` 2.480 ms / `values` 2.369 ms / `ravel` 2.373 ms; after `to_list` 1.600 ms / `values` 1.637 ms / `ravel` 1.399 ms | **`to_list` 11.30x faster than pandas `tolist`; FP-side 1.55x / 1.45x / 1.70x faster. Pandas `values`/`ravel` remain structural ndarray-view wins.** | ✅ KEEP — `Index::to_list()` now materializes owned `IndexLabel`s directly from unit, affine, two-run, strided, contiguous-Utf8, or typed backing instead of first building/caching a raw `Vec<i64>` through `int64_view()` and then mapping that vector to `IndexLabel::Int64`. Public alias outputs are unchanged, names are unaffected, and the affine regression test proves neither the owned-label cache nor the intermediate raw-i64 cache is populated by list aliases. This closes the Rust-owned materialization lever; pandas' `.values`/`.ravel()` O(1) ndarray views are still the broader typed-view API gap, not a list-alias loop issue. |
| RangeIndex median BOLD-VERIFY (uza04.170/cod-b) | 1M-label unit, stride-3, and descending `RangeIndex` shapes; 64 median calls per timed batch. pandas 2.2.3 local has no direct `RangeIndex.median()`, so comparator used prebuilt `pd.Series(idx).median()` over identical labels; FP used `bench_range_setops range_median 64` with warm `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`. | unit 737.961 ms / strided 727.262 ms / descending 712.997 ms | unit 0.000501 ms / strided 0.000500 ms / descending 0.000510 ms | **unit 1,472,976x / strided 1,454,525x / descending 1,398,033x faster** | ✅ VERIFIED EXISTING WIN — current `RangeIndex::median` is already closed-form and only evaluates the middle one or two labels through widened `i128` `value_at`; it does not allocate `values()` or `IndexLabel` vectors. No production code change was kept; this pass added only a reproducible `range_median` benchmark mode plus this ledger row. |
| RangeIndex diff constant-step BOLD-VERIFY (uza04.171/cod-b) | 1M-label unit, stride-3, and descending `RangeIndex` shapes, `periods=1`; pandas 2.2.3 local `pd.Series(idx).diff(1)` over identical labels vs `bench_range_setops range_diff`; warm `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`. | unit 0.587493 ms / strided 1.025182 ms / descending 0.540814 ms | before unit 2.561713 ms / strided 2.576221 ms / descending 2.560631 ms; after unit 0.563197 ms / strided 0.561974 ms / descending 0.555723 ms | **after unit 1.04x / strided 1.82x faster; descending 0.97x pandas (2.8% slower residual); FP-side 4.55x / 4.58x / 4.61x faster** | ✅ KEEP — `RangeIndex::diff` now fills boundary `None`s plus the constant arithmetic progression delta `step * periods` instead of recomputing two widened labels per output slot. Overflow behavior is preserved by computing the product in `i128` and filling valid slots with `None` when it cannot fit `i64`; period zero and out-of-range periods keep the previous semantics. |
| RangeIndex join same-lattice Int64 BOLD-VERIFY (uza04.190/cod-b) | 1M-label `RangeIndex(0, n, 1, name='k')` joined with flat Int64 `Index(n/2..n+n/2, name='k')`; `inner` and `outer`; pandas 2.2.3 local `RangeIndex.join(Index, how=...)` vs `bench_range_setops range_join`; warm `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`. | inner 3.807292 ms / outer 4.415635 ms | before inner 3.044637 ms / outer 10.109983 ms; after inner 1.233537 ms / outer 1.821050 ms | **inner 3.09x / outer 2.42x faster than pandas; FP-side 2.47x / 5.55x faster** | ✅ KEEP — direct RangeIndex-vs-Int64 joins now detect same-step affine Int64 slices. `inner` returns the lazy overlap span and `outer` returns the lazy contiguous extension when that exactly matches the existing self-then-new-other output order; non-affine, duplicate, off-lattice, prefix-extension, and mixed-label cases stay on the previous materializing/hash paths. |
| RangeIndex isin mark-position BOLD-VERIFY (ruthb/cod-b) | 1M-label `RangeIndex(0, n, 1).isin(values)` with deterministic mixed hit/miss/duplicate needles; small=1,024 needles, large=500,000 needles; pandas 2.2.3 local `RangeIndex.isin` vs `bench_range_setops range_isin`; warm `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`. | small 13.066309 ms / large 43.364404 ms | current small 0.020549 ms / large 3.966811 ms | **small 635.86x / large 10.93x faster than pandas** | ✅ VERIFIED EXISTING WIN — `RangeIndex::isin` already uses direct position marking from each needle (`position_of_value`) instead of building a needle set and scanning every range label. Duplicates collapse by overwriting the same mask slot, misses are ignored, ascending/descending/empty semantics are covered by existing `range_index_isin_marks_positions_without_hash_ruthb`; this pass added only the reproducible bench mode and closed the stale-open bead. |
| MultiIndex nunique direct-count retry (uza04.194/cod-b) | 1M-row two-level Utf8 `MultiIndex` with 700 x 700 level domains and 4,900 observed unique tuples; pandas 2.2.3 local `mi.nunique()` vs `bench_multiindex_dedup`; warm `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`. | `nunique` 16.775462 ms; `len(unique())` 15.925472 ms | current `nunique` 46.619 ms / `unique().len()` 47.966 ms; dense-presence candidate 53.465 ms | **current 0.36x pandas (2.78x slower); dense candidate 0.31x pandas and 0.87x current FP** | ❌ REVERT — current `MultiIndex::nunique` already avoids materializing the unique output via `identity_packed_keys()` plus `FxHashSet<u64>` (landed earlier in `5b96dcb49`), but still spends most time factorizing per-level Utf8 values and building packed-key vectors. A retry that counted a compact dense `Vec<bool>` presence table by packed key regressed to 53.465 ms, so the production hunk was removed. The retained change is only a reusable `bench_multiindex_dedup` `nunique`/`unique_len` timing lane; a real fix needs a deeper pack/count primitive that avoids per-level code vectors and repeated string hashing. |
| MultiIndex compact two-level identity-code sidecar (2tc1q/cod-b) | Same 1M-row two-level Utf8 `MultiIndex`, 700 x 700 level domains, 4,900 observed unique tuples; pandas 2.2.3 local `mi.nunique()` / `len(mi.unique())` vs `cargo run -p fp-index --example bench_multiindex_dedup --release -- 1000000 5`; warm `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`; final Rust run on RCH `vmi1149989`; checksum `8f340377c4582811`. | `nunique` 17.969 ms; `len(unique())` 15.984 ms | before `nunique` 54.031 ms / `unique().len()` 54.813 ms; after `duplicated` 1.798 ms / `nunique` 1.579 ms / `unique().len()` 2.235 ms | **`nunique` 11.38x faster than pandas; `unique().len()` 7.15x faster; FP-side `nunique` 34.22x faster** | ✅ KEEP — `MultiIndex` now builds a private optional first-seen identity-code sidecar only for two-level compact domains whose dense `(level0, level1)` table fits the existing bounded cell budget. `duplicated`, default `drop_duplicates`/`unique`, and `nunique` scan integer slots directly instead of rebuilding per-level code vectors and hashing tuple labels on every call; empty, wide, high-cardinality, deserialized/missing-sidecar, and non-compact cases keep the existing packed-key/tuple fallback. Observable levels, names, serde payloads, equality, output order, duplicate keep modes, and checksum are unchanged. |
| MultiIndex two-level Utf8 tuple set-ops borrowed keys (uza04.188/cod-b) | 1M-row two-level Utf8 `MultiIndex` set-op batch: `intersection(sort=False)` + `difference(sort=False)`, 700 x 700 level domains with 4,900 observed unique tuples; pandas 2.2.3 local vs `bench_multiindex_setop`; warm `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`. | 92.920 ms | before packed-key path 193.095 ms; after borrowed `(&str,&str)` tuple sets + direct two-level result builder + intersection early-stop 71.122 ms | **1.31x faster than pandas; FP-side 2.72x faster** | ✅ KEEP — the earlier FxHashSet migration was already present but still materialized per-level code vectors and full `u64` key arrays before hashing. The two-level all-Utf8 path now hashes borrowed tuple keys directly, clones only emitted unique rows, and stops `intersection` once every right-side unique key has been emitted. Output order, duplicate collapse, symmetric/union/difference behavior, and shared-name propagation are covered by `multi_index_two_utf8_setops_preserve_order_and_names_codb188`; non-Utf8 or wider MultiIndexes keep the existing packed/fallback paths. |
| CategoricalIndex factorize category-code sidecar (uza04.201/cod-b) | 1M-label low-cardinality string `CategoricalIndex` (100 categories, deterministic xorshift labels), `factorize()`; pandas 2.2.3 local `CategoricalIndex.factorize()` vs `probe_str_categorical`; warm `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`. | 2.951 ms | before categorical rank-map 7.958 ms; after category-code sidecar 0.944 ms; generic `Index` hash baseline 10.368 ms | **after 3.13x faster than pandas; FP-side 8.43x faster than pre-sidecar categorical path** | ✅ KEEP — `CategoricalIndex` now carries a private optional category-code sidecar for valid constructors and code-preserving transforms, so `factorize()` scans integer ranks instead of hashing each label string to recover its category rank. Public labels/categories/ordered/name remain unchanged; deserialized or intentionally invalid fixtures with missing sidecars fall back to the old rank/hash paths, and malformed sidecars are guarded before use.

First-seen tie order is preserved by recording the first rank encounter before the stable descending-count sort; missing or malformed sidecars fall back to the old rank/hash paths.

SeriesGroupBy.build_groups' generic loop calls `values()` per row and probes TWO hash structures (a `seen` set + the `groups` map). Added a Scalar-backed Utf8 fast path (gated non-contiguous): hoist `values()`, probe ONE `FxHashMap<&str, gid>`, append row indices into per-group Vecs. Bit-identical: same first-seen order/order_keys (ScalarKey::Utf8), same groups map. 32.7→13.1ms (2.5× FP-side). Guards: 202 fp-frame groupby tests, 108 fp-conformance groupby, fmt+clippy clean. |

The multi-key mixed Int64/Utf8 dense path (mkdense) only fired for CONTIGUOUS Utf8 (`as_utf8_contiguous`); Scalar-backed Utf8 (from_values/in-memory) fell to the generic per-row `Vec<ScalarKey>` heap-alloc + SipHash. Added a `KeyCol::StrScalar` arm that factorizes the `&str` from the materialized Scalar slice into dense codes, packed into the same mixed-radix direct-address gid table. Bit-identical: codes only pick the dense slot (bijective over the code ranges so first-seen slot order == first-seen key order); group_order keys reconstructed from `vals[row]` (ScalarKey::Utf8). Oracle-EXACT (50k, 37×13: 481 groups, vsum 2499760, sorted a00,b00→a36,b12). 104.6→70.3ms (1.49× FP-side). Guards: 202 fp-frame groupby tests, 108 fp-conformance groupby, fmt+clippy clean. |

Added an all-valid path emitting typed Bool (`from_bool_values`) — the `idx.contains` probe is unchanged, so bit-identical (`from_bool_values` == `from_values` over `[Bool,..]`). 132.5→64.0ms (2.07× FP-side). Oracle-EXACT (40k×3: true_count 88811). Guards: 25 fp-frame isin tests, fmt+clippy clean. Sister to the Series.isin Scalar-backed Utf8 fix. |
| Series.sort_values Float64/Int64 "spread" — stable pair sort ❌ REVERTED (1q4q4) | 2M f64/i64, sort_values(ascending), high-cardinality — **measured on TRULY-SHUFFLED data** | f64 196.8 / i64 209 ms | radix f64 239 / i64 230 ms | **radix 0.82× / 0.91× (LOSS); the pair-sort "fix" was 0.78× — a REGRESSION, REVERTED** | ❌ REVERTED (commits 9d0e56db + 24d3880f undone). **Measurement-error correction:** the bench's value generator `(i·2654435761)>>13` is MONOTONICALLY INCREASING in `i` (no overflow at 2M rows), so the "unique" data was *already sorted* — where a comparison `sort_by` is O(n) (detects the run) but the radix is not. That made the pair sort look like a 1.86× win (65ms). On a splitmix64-**shuffled** 2M f64 the pair sort is **251ms vs the radix 239ms** — a ~5% REGRESSION, and both LOSE to pandas (196.8ms, 0.78×/0.82×). Root cause of the radix's shuffled cost is NOT the argsort (order-independent counting sort) but `reorder_by_positions` gathering columns by a cache-random permutation. A comparison sort can't beat that. Lesson: **always bench sorts on shuffled data.** The radix path (original) is retained. |

Added a typed path: tile the contiguous `i64`/`f64` buffer directly via `from_i64_values`/`from_f64_values`. BIT-IDENTICAL (8 fp-frame melt tests pass). 175→81ms (2.2× FP-side). Other dtypes keep Scalar tiling. (Context from the same reshape sweep: DataFrame whole-frame reductions are huge wins — df.std **42×**, sem **37×**, skew **19×** vs pandas' slow per-column path; `DataFrame.stack` stays 0.34× — the documented STRUCTURAL flat-composite-string index vs pandas' MultiIndex, not a typed-output gap.) |

Added the Scalar-backed Utf8 sibling: `FxHashMap<&[u8], ()>` of the string needles probed over the borrowed bytes, emitting typed Bool (`from_bool_values`).

Replaced with a single SEQUENTIAL pass tracking the best value + its row per group (dense gid by `key − min`, `data[row]` read in order). BIT-IDENTICAL to the f64 `agg_scalar` path: same first-seen group order, same first-row-wins strictly-better tie, same `Scalar::Utf8(label.to_string())` output (35 fp-frame + 18 fp-conformance idx tests pass). idxmax 11.7→1.98ms (**5.9× FP-side**), idxmin 13.1→2.1ms (6.2×). Lesson: a typed `data[idx]` group scan is still RANDOM access — the sequential `data[row]` rewrite is the lever for any `agg_scalar`-style op. Non-f64 values / non-dense Int64 keys keep `agg_scalar`. **SIBLING (same lever): SeriesGroupBy.all()/any() — 0.29×/0.32× → 0.57×/0.62× (2× FP-side, 7.5→3.8ms), bit-identical sequential AND/OR fold (`group_bool_reduce_dense`, typed Bool/Int64/Float64 + dense Int64 key; 137 tests pass). Still a loss — pandas' vectorized bool reduction is only ~2.2ms, so FP's histogram-scan + per-row gid lookup can't fully close it.** **SIBLING (same lever, moments): SeriesGroupBy.sem()/skew()/kurt() — sem 0.08×→0.50× (42→6.8ms, 6.2× FP-side), skew 0.14×→0.68× (31→6.6ms, 4.7×). They went through `agg_values_scalar` (a `Vec<Scalar>` materialized PER GROUP + `nansem`/`nanskew`/`nankurt`); replaced by `group_moment_dense` — a typed TWO-PASS mean-centered moment pass (pass 1 sum+finite count→mean; pass 2 Σ(x−mean).powi(2/3/4)) reproducing each formula EXACTLY (bit-identical; 271 fp-frame tests pass). Still a loss: pandas fuses grouped moments in ONE pass (3.4/4.5ms) while FP's nanskew is two-pass mean-centered (a one-pass rewrite would need a golden regen). **DataFrameGroupBy.idxmax()/idxmin() (multi-col): same dense sequential scan with ONE shared int64_dense_grouping pass (`try_idx_extreme_dense`) — FLIPPED 0.19×→4.2× WIN, 0.23×→4.9× WIN (86/77→3.9/3.6ms, 22× FP-side); pandas DataFrame idxmax has per-col overhead (16.3/17.9ms).

FLIPPED 0.30×→4.4× WIN (all), 0.30×→4.6× WIN (any) (61/67→4.3ms, 15× FP-side). Bit-identical (137 fp-frame tests; AND/OR order-independent, seeded with identity).** **DataFrameGroupBy.first()/last() (multi-col): the dense `aggregate_int64_dense` path was 10× slower than a dedicated scan AND only handled f64/i64 (a Bool/Utf8 col forced the slow generic path). Added `try_first_last_dense` — one shared int64_dense_grouping pass finds each group`s first/last ROW, then every value column is gathered at those rows via zero-copy `Column::take_positions` (dtype-preserving, ANY column type). FLIPPED 0.49×→9.9× WIN (first), 0.52×→7.5× WIN (last) (40→2.0/2.7ms, 20× FP-side). Bit-identical for all-valid columns (93 fp-frame tests); nullable cols (skipna) keep the generic path.** **DataFrameGroupBy.ffill()/bfill() (multi-col transform): build_groups + per-column `Vec<Scalar>` materialization + scattered-index fill. Added `try_fill_dense` — per-column SOURCE row (last/next non-null in group within limit) computed in one sequential pass over the cheap `ValidityMask`, then `take_positions` gathers the fill (any dtype). ffill 0.68×→1.16× WIN, bfill 0.68×→0.98× (161/169→94/117ms, 1.5–1.7× FP-side); output-bound (full n-row frame gather) limits the gain vs the reductions.

Bit-identical (old-FP hash == dense hash A/B; 3 fp-frame + 3 fp-conformance). cumcount/size already WIN (1.36×/2.2×).** **Series.str.slice() — general arm collected a Vec<char> PER element (heap alloc/row); added ASCII forward-slice (step 1/None) byte-slice fast path resolving Python-style negative/OOB bounds against byte len. 0.56×→1.27× WIN (187→82ms, 2.3× FP-side). Bit-identical: 9-case oracle (negative/OOB/start>stop/empty/None) == Python exactly, 25 fp-frame tests. (str.replace 1.3× / split_get 5.4× / strip 6.7× already WIN.)** **Series.map(dict) Int64→Int64 — the typed path resolved over an FxHashMap<i64,&Scalar>; the &Scalar value is a pointer into the scattered mapping Vec, so every per-row probe was a cache miss. Replaced with a TYPED i64→i64 resolver: dense direct-address table when mapping keys form a bounded range (common categorical re-encode), else value-inlined FxHashMap<i64,i64>. Full-coverage map 9.9→2.18ms (4.5× FP-side, 0.38×→1.74× WIN). Bit-identical (first-occurrence-wins, unmapped→NaN fall-through; partial+dup oracle == pandas, 32 fp-frame tests).

Bit-identical (key-aligned oracle == pandas; 26 fp-frame + 13 fp-conformance). NOTE: a per-value last-seen-EPOCH array (first attempt) MIScounts interleaved/shuffled keys (g0..g1..g0 re-counts a shared value) and passed 26 tests but failed the A/B-vs-old-FP oracle — the 2D (group,value) bitset is the correct structure (gated to bounded group×value cell budget).** **SeriesGroupBy.nunique (same lever): was 1.28× (dense buckets but per-group FxHashSet); same 2D-bitset → 1.28×→11.9× WIN (52→5.6ms, 9.3× FP-side). Bit-identical (3-way shuffled oracle MY==OLD_FP==PANDAS; 26 fp-frame + conformance).** **cut/qcut typed input — gathered floats via series.values() (1M Scalar boxes); added as_f64_slice fast path (all-valid no-NaN f64 => all Some, no materialization). cut 0.17×→0.25× (120→82ms), qcut 0.39×→0.55× (145→104ms), 1.4–1.45× FP-side, bit-identical (15 fp-frame + 9 fp-conformance). STILL LOSS — residual is the 1M Utf8 interval-label output (no Categorical dtype) vs pandas Categorical codes + the Vec<Option<f64>>; structural, deeper flip needs a Categorical column type.** **Series.str.zfill()/pad() — both built a separate `padding` String AND `format!`d it with `s` = 2 heap allocs + format machinery per row; replaced with ONE `with_capacity` build (push padding + str).

Replaced with a dense O(n) pass over `int64_dense_grouping`'s gids: nth = the row where the group's occurrence counter first hits `n` (emitted in the dense `order` ⇒ same group order); head/tail = a shared `dense_group_positions(keep(pos,size))` row-position filter (rows visited in ascending index order ⇒ `keep_indices` already sorted). nth's gather now uses zero-copy `Column::take_positions` + `Index::take`. BIT-IDENTICAL (235 fp-frame groupby tests pass). nth 6.5→2.0ms, head 6.5→3.0ms. ❌ Still a loss: pandas' selection ops factorize+select in fewer passes (0.80/1.38ms); FP's histogram scan + 8 MB `gid_per_row` + counter pass can't fully match. Direct key-offset indexing (skip `gid_per_row`) is the further lever. |

Now those funcs wrap the key+value into a 2-col frame and reuse `DataFrameGroupBy.transform` (transform broadcasts per row, so group order is irrelevant ⇒ bit-identical; 48 fp-frame transform tests pass). 62→17.5ms. ❌ Still a loss: residual is the frame-construction overhead + FP's multi-pass dense std vs pandas' very fast fused series-transform (9.9ms); a direct dense SGB accumulator (no frame wrap) is the further lever, ~0.6× ceiling. nth (0.12×) and head (0.21×) are sibling selection-op gaps found in the same sweep, not yet addressed. |

The dict form missed it. Now, when every aggregated column is numeric and every func is dense-reducible (sum/mean/count/min/max/var/std/first/last/prod/median), route through `agg_typed_pairs` and rename its `{col}_{func}` outputs to the dict form's single-level `{col}`. BIT-IDENTICAL (dense engine reproduces `build_groups`' first-seen/ascending-key group order + per-group row-order reductions; 234 fp-frame + 120 fp-conformance groupby/agg tests pass). sum+std 70→6.1ms (**11.5× FP-side**). `as_index=false` / non-numeric / skew/kurt/sem/nunique keep the generic path. |

So abs reads 40MB + writes 40MB (map) + reads 40MB + writes 40MB (Arc copy) = 160MB vs pandas' in-place 80MB. The `f64_finite_witness` is O(1) cached (NOT the cost); `collect::<Arc<[f64]>>()` wouldn't help (std routes Arc-from-iter through a Vec). Taxes EVERY f64-producing op but dominates only when compute is trivial (abs 0.35× while clip/cumsum, with real per-element work, are 0.95×/0.86×). **FIX LEVER:** a Vec-backed (or `Arc<Vec<f64>>`) all-valid-Float64 `ScalarValues` variant so a freshly-produced `Vec<f64>` is MOVED in, not copied — a structural fp-columnar change (storage enum + `as_f64_slice`); deferred for a coordinated pass (fp-columnar is actively peer-developed). |

DataFrameGroupBy cum/shift/diff WIN because pandas' DataFrame-groupby carries per-column+frame overhead; the SeriesGroupBy row below stays the residual (pandas Series-groupby is the lean 3.7-4.5ms Cython path).

Fused: index the per-group accumulator by the key's offset `(key − min)` DIRECTLY in the single accumulation pass — group numbering is irrelevant to cum* (per-key fold in row order), so bit-identical. ~15% FP-side (cumsum 11.7→10.1ms, cummax 12→10ms); 62 cum tests pass. ❌ Still a pandas loss: the residual (NaN gate scan + `i64_dense_histogram_range` min/max scan + accumulate + output alloc = ~3 O(n) passes) can't match pandas' single fused factorize+scan Cython loop. diff/shift genuinely need per-group position state (`gid_per_row`), so the same fuse doesn't apply; left as documented Cython-hard losses. |

Sister of the skew/kurt fix: `RollingPairwiseMomentState` keeps O(1) incremental sums (x,y,x²,y²,xy) but ALSO two `BTreeMap`s (`distinct_x`,`distinct_y`) used solely for `constant_x()`/`constant_y()` (cov→0 / corr→NaN on a constant axis). Maintaining both multisets every step was the dominant cost (cov w=100 was 412ms = 0.11×). For no-NaN/no-missing data each axis is constant iff its trailing run of equal values covers the window — pandas' O(1) `num_consecutive_same_value` counter per axis; `run >= nobs` is BIT-IDENTICAL to `distinct.len() <= 1`. NaN/missing keep the multiset path. corr 400→178ms, cov 412→172ms; 12 fp-frame + 21 fp-conformance tests pass. ❌ Still a loss: residual is the per-call `pairs: Vec<Option<(f64,f64)>>` build + `align` setup plus per-element output arithmetic (2 sqrts) — a separate larger optimization (work on typed slices, skip align on identical indices). **✅ UPDATE 2026-07-02 (BlackThrush): NOW A WIN — this residual was subsequently closed.

For the O(n·m) extraction that Scalar materialization dominated the many-column matrix. Added a typed `(&[f64], &ValidityMask)` path emitting `NaN` at invalid slots — BIT-IDENTICAL to the generic path (valid slot → `data[i]` == `Scalar::Float64(v).to_f64()`; invalid → `NaN` == `Null.to_f64().unwrap_or(NaN)`, which the pairwise NaN-skip drops as before). corr 30-col 32.7→21.5ms; goldens + `series_cov_pairwise_complete_nan` + corr_typed_conformance all green (3089+ fp-frame lib, 0 fail). ❌ Residual few-col×many-row LOSS (3×2M flat at 0.28×): there the O(n²·M) per-pair loop dominates (extraction is a small fraction) and the per-pair moments DON'T separate for INDEPENDENT NaN patterns (nobs varies per pair), so the register-blocked Gram fast-path (used for complete columns) can't apply — matching pandas' `nancorr` here needs either a shared-NaN-pattern special case or SIMD-with-reassociation (golden regen).

The nullable path (`as_f64_slice_with_validity`) did `validity.get(i)` PER ELEMENT (a ~4-branch, non-inlined, un-vectorizable call) writing `NaN` at invalid slots, then `from_f64_values` RE-SCANNED the whole output for NaN to rebuild validity. But round PRESERVES missingness exactly (a present value never rounds to NaN; a missing slot stays missing) ⇒ output validity == INPUT validity. So: (1) drop the per-element branch — round EVERY slot over the raw `&[f64]` (a masked slot rounds to a finite value that the mask then hides), giving a branch-free vectorizable map; (2) reuse the input validity mask via `from_f64_values_with_validity` (no NaN rescan); (3) `par_map_vec_f64` fan-out (elementwise ⇒ order-independent ⇒ bit-identical). 22.88→7.29ms (branch+rescan removal) →3.59ms (parallel).

Same structural ceiling as the deferred "f64 Arc copy-on-produce" — beating pandas on a pure elementwise f64→f64 nullable op needs an alloc-free/zero-free write path.

Same lever + same residual as the `round` row below: the nullable path did `validity.get(i)` PER ELEMENT + wrote NaN + `from_f64_values` RE-SCANNED to rebuild validity. abs PRESERVES missingness (|present| never NaN — |finite|=finite, |±inf|=+inf) ⇒ output validity == INPUT validity, so abs EVERY slot over the raw &[f64] (masked datum abs's harmlessly) via `par_map_vec_f64` and reuse the input mask via `from_f64_values_with_validity` (no rescan). Bit-identical (present slots `data[i].abs()`; missing slots view as missing either way). ❌ Still 2.7× a LOSS: numpy's `np.abs` is 0.86ms (tight vectorized C); fp residual is the 16MB output alloc + `par_map`'s `vec![0.0;n]` zero-then-overwrite + validity clone + lazy build — the SAME structural ceiling as round / the deferred "f64 Arc copy-on-produce". |

The all-valid path (`as_f64_slice`) vectorizes the `v>=lo && v<=hi` predicate to 0.94ms (already a pandas WIN). The nullable path (`as_f64_slice_with_validity`) is 8.3× slower. **Tried & REVERTED**: replacing the per-element `valid.get(i)` branch with a vectorized predicate-over-all-slots + a packed-word `false`-clear pass — gained <10% (8.23→7.51ms). The branch is NOT the bottleneck: between's output is Bool with **missing→`false`** (NOT missingness-preserving like round/abs, so the input mask can't just be reused), so the mask MUST be APPLIED to n elements — an inherently O(n) scalar pass (`flags[i] &= valid(i)`) that a `Vec<bool>` (1 byte/elem) can't vectorize the way a packed-bitmask word-AND could. A real flip needs either (a) a packed-bitmask Bool output so validity applies as 31k word-ANDs, or (b) relying on the missing-slot datum (0.0) failing the predicate — unsafe unless the 0.0 convention is guaranteed. gt_scalar shows the same class (all-valid 0.57 / nullable 1.74ms = 3×). **SWEEP 2026-07-02 (all WIN, surface dominated, DON'T re-probe): str ops 7-28×, groupby Utf8 single+multi 2.6-3.5×, pivot_table all aggs 1.9-3.2×, sort_str 5×, dup/isin/nunique WIN, rolling corr/cov 8×, reshape gb-rank 6.8× / gb-transform 3.4× / crosstab 14× / factorize 4.7×.** |

Removes the `Vec<Scalar>` materialization (cleaner, 27 fp-columnar + fp-frame clip tests green). ❌ Only reaches PARITY (not a win like idxmax/corr): unlike abs/round, pandas' `clip` is ITSELF bandwidth-bound (~8.7ms/2M — a full 16MB-read + 16MB-write f64→f64 map), so both sides hit the memory wall; `par_map`'s `vec![0.0;n]` pre-zero (extra 16MB) offsets the parallelism (serial = 9.3ms, worse).

Replaced the nullable tally's per-element `validity.get(i)` skip with a packed-validity-word `trailing_zeros` scan (idxmax lever) — visits present rows in the SAME ascending first-seen order, so the desc-count sort + labels are unchanged. At LOW cardinality the tally is L1-resident so `get()` dominated (31.1→24.8ms, 1.25× fp-side). ❌ Still not a clean win — **alien-graveyard analysis (Swiss Table §2413 / khash)**: the residual is the f64 hash floor + a CARDINALITY CROSSOVER in the two tally structures. All-valid uses `FxHashMap<u64>` (hashbrown Swiss Table): WINS low-card (13.4 vs 24.7ms = 1.84×) but LOSES high-card (146→170 vs 52ms = 0.36×). Nullable uses the custom inline-key open-addr `Float64BitsIndex`: better high-card (106 vs FxHashMap's 146) but worse low-card (24.8 vs 13.4). Neither structure wins both regimes; fp already implements BOTH recommended primitives (Swiss Table + custom open-addr), so beating pandas' khash across the board needs a CARDINALITY-ADAPTIVE structure selector (start FxHashMap, promote to inline-open-addr when distinct-count exceeds an L2-resident threshold) — a Tier-B lever (golden-safe but non-trivial, gated by the strict value_counts sort output). Recorded so future work targets the adaptive selector, not the already-optimal per-regime structures. |

Finger-search instead: sort the needles ONCE (cache-local `sort_unstable_by` on an index permutation) then sweep the haystack with a single MONOTONE pointer (each answer ≥ the previous since needles ascend), O(n + m·log m) with SEQUENTIAL haystack reads, then scatter back to needle order. Converting random probes → sequential is the whole win. Bit-identical to per-needle `partition_point` (`pos` stops at first `data[pos] ≥ k` [left] / `> k` [right]; equal needles share `pos`): **differential 0/80** (left+right × random haystacks/needles/dup values) + searchsorted lib tests green.

Gain only ~0.3ms → this PROVES the ~2M sequential divisions in `(old_wt*avg + x)/(old_wt+new_wt)` are the floor (≈6-7ns/elem, ~10ms of the 15ms), NOT the output allocation. pandas' Cython runs the same recurrence at 12.17ms (better division pipelining).

Sort the present values ONCE (O(n log n)) then read each quantile with `percentile_with_interpolation` (O(1) each) → O(n log n + k), exactly what pandas does. Bit-identical: the single-q fast path `typed_quantile_f64` mirrors sort+percentile (its doc + the nullable-quantile commit), so per-q over the shared sorted array reproduces every value — **digest 3172682112145691774 UNCHANGED before/after** + quantile lib tests green.

Fused min/max into `moments_by_pair`'s first pass (`f64::min`/`f64::max` accumulators alongside sum/cnt) and extended the gate to accept them. Now one grouping serves all funcs: 97.3→18.6ms.

Unlike DataFrameGroupBy (whose per-func path re-factorizes the key once per func, so fusion won 0.91×→2.77×), the SeriesGroupBy generic per-func path dispatches each func through its OWN dense sub-reducer (`gb.first()`/`gb.last()`/`gb.sum()` — try_first_last_dense etc.), which is already near-optimal; the accumulator path's `dense_group_ids()` + bookkeeping adds overhead without a win. LESSON: fusion only helps when the per-func fallback RE-GROUPS per func; if each func already has a dense single-grouping reducer, fusion is pure overhead. SeriesGroupBy first/last stays on the generic path (0.91×, near-parity — not worth chasing). |

Replaced with a packed-validity-word scan (idxmax lever): an all-invalid word fills 64 slots with `fv` outright; a valid/partial word tests only its bits (still NaN-checked — a valid-bit NaN counts as missing). Bit-identical to the per-element select (same `(valid && !nan) ? d : fv`) — fillna lib tests green. This flips the loss because the output alloc is unavoidable on BOTH sides (fillna materializes a full n-row column, like pandas), so removing the per-element branch is the whole margin — UNLIKE abs/round (where numpy's sub-2ms vectorized loop stays ahead of fp's alloc+par_map). |

Isolation showed `index.take`=1.24ms but `col.take_positions`=**89ms** was the whole cost: take_positions' typed nullable-f64 gather gate matches only the `LazyNullableFloat64`/`LazyAllValidFloat64` VARIANTS, so a `from_values`-built column (`ColumnData::Float64` + NaN-derived mask) fell to a per-row `Scalar::clone` gather. But dropna's kept positions are ALL PRESENT ⇒ output all-valid ⇒ NullKind irrelevant: gather the raw f64 at each present slot straight into an all-valid column (`from_f64_values_owned`) + take the index in ONE packed-word pass, bypassing take_positions. Bit-identical: 60-seed differential digest (sizes/nan-rates/all-nan/none, labels+values) before==after=18164890425099990174. ❌ Still 2.2× a loss: the residual 22ms is the safe-Rust scalar COMPACTION (word-scan + 2 pushes/kept row) vs numpy's SIMD masked-compress; hard to match without vectorized compact. **FOLLOW-UP (broader): take_positions' typed-gather gate omits `ColumnData::Float64` — a from_values nullable-f64 column hits the Scalar-clone gather for sort/iloc/dedup row reorders too; safe to add when the missing convention is NaN (a NullKind check), separate from dropna (where it's moot).** |

All three route through `Column::take_positions` for the row reorder; its typed nullable-f64 gather gate matches only the `Lazy*Float64` VARIANTS, so a `from_values`-built column falls to a per-row `Scalar::clone` gather (take isolation: 182ms all in take_positions). Extending the gate to `ColumnData::Float64` is what the dropna fix (55e90aa57) effectively did for PRESENT-only slots — but for take/sort/dedup the output CONTAINS missing rows, and **a nullable from_values Float64 column keeps NullKind-preserving Eager values** (`from_inferred_float64_values`: `values = from_vec(coerced)` with the original `Null(kind)`, paired with `data = ColumnData::Float64`). A typed f64 gather emits `Null(NaN)` for every missing slot, corrupting a legally-held `Null(NaT)`/`Null(Null)` → NOT bit-identical. **THE BLOCKER (one sentence): take_positions can't use the fast typed f64 gather on a nullable Float64 column because that column preserves per-slot NullKind in Eager values that the raw f64 buffer can't reproduce.** SAFE-FIX DIRECTION (deferred, needs a build+verify): add a cached per-column "all-missing-are-Null(NaN)" witness (the pandas-faithful Float64 case — pandas Float64 missing is ALWAYS NaN) and take the typed gather when it holds; else keep the Scalar gather. dropna already sidesteps this (present-only). **ATTEMPT FAILED + REVERTED (2026-07-02): tried the safe-fix at CONSTRUCTION — `from_inferred_float64_values` building a canonical `LazyNullableFloat64` when every null is `Null(NaN)` (guarding out present-`Float64(NaN)`/`NaT`/`Null`). Perf was promising (take 186→78ms, sort 261→140ms=0.92×, dedup 96→65ms) and an 80-seed variant-digest A/B FALSELY matched, but the full suite caught 8 failures: `from_f64_values_with_validity(fdata,…)` with a NaN datum at a missing slot materializes `Float64(NaN)`, not `Null(NaN)` (the Eager path's value) — the missing slot must carry a NON-NaN sentinel (0.0 per the nullable convention), and even corrected it yields NO clean win (take stays 0.18× random-gather-bound). LESSON: a variant-digest bench can false-match; the FULL suite is the real gate for foundational constructor changes.** **✅ FIXED (2026-07-02, commit next): re-attempted with the NON-NaN (0.0) sentinel at missing slots — LazyNullableFloat64.values() emits Float64(datum) when `validity || datum.is_nan()`, so a 0.0 datum at a validity-clear slot correctly materializes Null(NaN).

The prior nunique commit (118827a8f) swapped `with_capacity(n)` → `default()` — a WIN for high-card (cache) but a SEVERE regression for LOW-card: default-grow keeps a high-load-factor table with collision chains → lowcard nunique 176ms (0.17× — was ~13-20ms). The capacity lever is CARDINALITY-DEPENDENT: pre-size-to-n is zero-collision + L1-hot for few distinct but cache-COLD for many; default is the reverse.

The documented "factorize wide-i64 0.32×" is now 1.43× — the floor closed. i64/datetime nunique FxHashSet sites are cap-NEUTRAL: bounded-range i64 uses the dense-bitset path (no hashset), and wide-range i64 over n rows is ~all-unique (grows to n either way). So the dedup-capacity lever is EXHAUSTED for impactful sites; the only residual high-card loss is value_counts f64 at 0.52× (khash integer-hash constant floor, not table sizing). |

The all-unique fast path + capped FxHashMap<u64> tally already dominate khash. **splitmix64-key lever REJECTED (negative result, don't re-try):** applying the mixf64/mode/unique splitmix finalizer to the all-valid tally's FxHashMap key is bit-transparent (digests IDENTICAL all 5 regimes) but a same-build A/B REGRESSION — mid-50k 22.96→25.93 (+13%), 300k 96.48→100.12, extreme 263.94→287.86 (+9%). value_counts keys (`sm%card`) are already well-distributed so the extra 2M×(3 mul+shift) mix costs more than the clustering it removes (unlike unique/mode, whose data clustered). LESSON: cross-run baselines are phantoms — a splitmix "win" vs a 113ms other-run number vanished in same-build A/B (sort-bench-monotonic pitfall). value_counts f64 is OFF the structural-floor list. |

Maintaining that multiset every step was the whole cost (skew w=100 was 139ms = 0.17×). For no-NaN/no-missing data a window is constant iff its trailing run of equal values covers it — pandas' O(1) `num_consecutive_same_value` counter; `counter >= nobs` is BIT-IDENTICAL to `distinct.len() <= 1` (no nulls interrupt the run, `value==prev` matches `value_key` incl. −0.0==0.0). NaN/missing keep the multiset path. skew 139→57ms, kurt 128→44ms; 38 fp-frame + 13 fp-conformance tests pass. ❌ Still a pandas loss: residual is the per-element `central_m3`/`m4` arithmetic + `s2.powf(1.5)`. The powf→`s2*sqrt(s2)` lever (≤1 ULP, the expanding-skew fix) was tried but breaks `dataframe_rolling_skew_golden_basic` (EXACT golden) — flipping to a win needs a golden regen, deferred. |

Added a sorted-multiset window (shared `ROLLING_SORTED_WINDOW_MAX_W=4096`): the k-th order statistic is `win[k]` by direct index. **BIT-IDENTICAL** — `win[k]` == `uniq[fen_kth(k)]` (k-th smallest in the window), `eval_kth` unchanged; oracle-EXACT vs pandas (median hash 2790247070565799993, q25 988868036354512953). Order-independent ⇒ serves centered windows too. median w=100 **1000→96ms (10.4× FP-side)**. NaN/-0.0/wide windows keep the Fenwick.

Added `rolling_rank_sorted_window`: the window's valid values kept in a `Vec<f64>` sorted by `total_cmp` (a multiset), slid via binary-search insert/remove — O(w) per slide but contiguous/branch-predictable/cache-hot. Gated to trailing + non-`dense` + w≤4096 (`ROLLING_RANK_SORTED_MAX_W`); centered/dense/wide windows keep the Fenwick. w=100 **1228→159ms (7.7× FP-side)**. BIT-IDENTICAL to the Fenwick path (`total_cmp` is the same total order its `uniq` uses; identical c_less/c_eq + na_option formulas; trailing ⇒ `first`==`max`). Oracle-EXACT vs pandas for average/min/max ascending (`first` is unsupported by pandas rolling rank; FP keeps the golden `==max`).

The tie-walk reads `pairs[k].0` with no indirection. **Re-validated on splitmix-SHUFFLED data** (the original ledger's "2.10×" used accidentally-monotonic data; the real wins are larger and hold across every method): avg-unique 132ms vs pandas 437ms = 3.3×, avg-ties 37.9ms vs 238ms = 6.3×, first 115ms vs 326ms = 2.8×. Unlike sort_values, rank does NOT gather columns by the permutation, so the no-indirection tie-walk is a genuine FP-side win, not a monotonic artifact.

Oracle-EXACT (40k: full sum 659998.5; partial nulls 1738). ❌ A bounded-range direct-address probe was tried (21.9→19.3ms, ~10%) and REVERTED as ~0-gain over its complexity — the residual is structural: pandas maps an int dict via a fully vectorized C int→array gather into a numpy Float64 array (7.4ms), which a Rust per-row probe + 16 MB owned `Vec<f64>` alloc can't match.

The Utf8-key map path typed-output only Utf8→Utf8; a Utf8→Float64 dict (string category → numeric encoding, common in ML preprocessing) fell to a `Vec<Scalar::Float64>` (32 B/elem; no per-elem heap alloc, so less severe than the Box<str> cases, hence only near-parity). Added a Float64-output sub-path emitting a typed Float64 column (8 B/elem) via `from_f64_values` for full coverage; partial coverage bails to the `&str`-probe scalar path (Null for unmapped).

The Int64-key map path had a typed-output sub-path only for Int64→Int64; an Int64→Utf8 dict (integer code → string label, a common encode) fell to a `Vec<Scalar::Utf8>` = 2M `Box<str>` clones, while pandas returns pointer-copies to ~20 interned strings. Added an Int64→Utf8 sub-path: for full coverage, emit a CONTIGUOUS Utf8 column (one shared byte buffer) via `from_utf8_contiguous`. Bit-identical; partial coverage bails to the Scalar path (Null for unmapped). 173→18.7ms (9.2× FP-side). Oracle-EXACT (40k: full byte-hash 8439260058170857572 / totlen 302610; partial nulls 1738).

Added a Utf8 path: `FxHashMap<&str, &Scalar>` over borrowed keys; when all mapping values are Utf8 AND every row maps (full coverage), emit a CONTIGUOUS Utf8 column (one shared byte buffer, no per-row alloc) via `from_utf8_contiguous`. Bit-identical to the `Vec<Scalar::Utf8>` the generic path builds; partial coverage falls to the `&str`-probe scalar path (Null(NaN) for unmapped). 203→44.1ms (4.6× FP-side).

Generalized `dense_group_ids_for_order`'s Int64-only composite to a mixed Int64/Utf8 `KeyCol` mixed-radix index (Utf8 columns factorized to first-seen codes + a `str->code` map so each `group_order` Utf8 key resolves by string content). The all-Int64 case stays bit-identical (same `(v-min)*stride` slot).

The typed dense moments path (`agg_typed_pairs_dense_f64_moments`) needs `dense_group_ids_for_order`, which was Int64-keys ONLY (`as_i64_slice()?` per by-column); a Utf8 key returned None, dropping multi-agg to the generic per-(group,func) Scalar gather (4 funcs × per-group materialize). Added a single-Utf8-key branch: factorize the borrowed &str to first-seen gids + translate each `group_order` entry via the same map (HashMap matches by string content), feeding the existing one-pass per-gid sum/mean/count/var/std accumulators.

SeriesGroupBy's `dense_group_ids` (the gid source for `try_cum_dense` + other dense SeriesGroupBy ops) had Int64 + contiguous-Utf8 paths but not Scalar-backed Utf8, which fell to the generic per-group `Vec<Scalar>` gather. Added the Scalar-backed Utf8 sibling (first-seen `FxHashMap<&str, gid>`, gated `as_utf8_contiguous().is_none()`), mirroring the `transform_dense_gids` fix. Covers cumsum/cumprod/cummax/cummin (and any dense SeriesGroupBy consumer) on Scalar-backed Utf8. Bit-identical: row-order per-gid fold == generic. 43.8→12.6ms (3.5× FP-side).

Added a single-Utf8-key fast path mirroring the wide-i64 hash path: probe `FxHashMap<&str, gid>` on the borrowed string — no per-row Vec.

Resolving each axis independently also handles MIXED axes (Datetime64 rows × Int64 cols, as benched). Labels/names mirror the generic path (Int64→to_string, Datetime64→format_datetime_ns, Utf8→string); sort == scalar_key_cmp. 48.6→15.9ms (3.06× FP-side); i64/Utf8 paths unchanged (no regression).

Extended the shared dense builder (`pivot_dense_build`, now used by BOTH the Int64 and Utf8 helpers) with min/max: per-cell `f64::min`/`f64::max` fold over the INFINITY/NEG_INFINITY seed in ROW ORDER == generic `vals.iter().copied().fold(±INF, f64::min/max)`, bit-identical incl. the NaN-skipping f64::min/max semantics.

The generic Utf8 path clones a `String` for BOTH keys of EVERY row into a nested `String->(String->i64)` map. Fix: reuse the pivot factorize lever — each all-valid Utf8 column → dense sorted-rank u32 codes in one pass (shared `pivot_factorize_utf8_sorted`), co-occurrences tallied into a direct-address i64 grid, every cell emitted Int64 (0 for absent). 137→24.9ms (5.5× FP-side). Pure-Utf8 has no Int64/Utf8 stringified-bucket merge quirk, so factorizing raw strings is exact; rows/cols sort by `str::cmp` == `pivot_axis_scalar_cmp`.

Utf8-keyed pivot's cost is dominated by ScalarKey STRING HASHING, not the Vec<f64> groups churn (a generic dense-scatter that only killed the Vec was ~0-gain, REVERTED). Fix: FACTORIZE each Utf8 key column to dense u32 codes in ONE pass (1 hash/row/col = 2× total vs the generic ~4×: idx+col unique-collect + both halves of every (ScalarKey,ScalarKey) groups-tuple), sort distinct by `str::cmp` (== `scalar_key_cmp` for Utf8) and remap codes→sorted rank, then the SAME bit-identical Int64 dense row-order scatter. 90.9→26.7ms (3.4× FP-side).

| Series.map Float64 dense integer-key table (0jdij+vynf7+hbq6y, bench_map_cc deferred) | 2M f64, 50-entry zero-based full-coverage map, sequential warm best-of-7 CPU7 | 12.063 ms | 1.713 ms | **7.04× faster** | ✅ FIXED default construction lane — hbq6y applies the Alien Graveyard region/lazy-layout lever already present in fp-columnar: the periodic dense-code witness now returns a `LazyRepeatedSlicesFloat64` tape instead of expanding the 50-value output block 40k times, and the witness scan uses a rolling expected-code counter instead of per-row `% period`. Same-tree A/B: 16.062 ms vynf7 baseline → 3.064 ms lazy repeated-slice output → 1.713 ms counter witness = **9.38× FP-side**; pandas 2.2.3 is 12.063 ms, so the prior 0.75× loss flips to a 7.04× win. Exactness is still guarded by a full source scan and all non-cyclic sources keep the direct-address fallback. Focused conformance green: 19 `series_map_*` tests + 8 fp-columnar factorize tests + 4 FxHash order tests. |
| Series.map Float64 dense integer-key table (hbq6y+p0irg, bench_map_cc materialize) | Same workload, `materialize` mode calls `out.values()` in the timed window | 12.075 ms | 27.348 ms | **0.44× (2.26× slower)** | 🔴 RESIDUAL LOSS — forced public `values()` still materializes a `Vec<Scalar>` over the lazy repeated-slice Float64 column; p0irg intentionally did not ship another enum-boxing materializer after qngdp proved that family regressed. This remains the honest scalar consumption-path loss. |
| Series.map Float64 repeated-slice materialization probes (qngdp) | Same workload; release binary built with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b rch exec -- cargo build -p fp-frame --example bench_map_cc --release`; local CPU7 timing | 12.188-12.502 ms | 30.838-33.013 ms | **0.38-0.40× (2.5-2.6× slower)** | ❌ REVERT / NO-SHIP — two "bold" materializers worsened the residual: current-head baseline before probes was deferred ~1.72 ms and materialize 27.646 ms; a typed-cache/threaded Scalar fill regressed to 33.013 ms, and a scalar-block repeated-slice fill still regressed to 30.838 ms. Cause: forced public `values()` still boxes every f64 into `Scalar`, while the probes added zero-init/thread setup or an extra scalar tape. Code reverted; keep hbq6y's lazy construction win and route deeper to public typed numeric consumption, an Arrow/numpy-style result buffer, or API-level avoidance of `values()` for numeric pipelines. |
| Series.map Float64 repeated-slice typed numeric consumption (p0irg, bench_map_cc `numpy`) | Same 2M f64 / 50-entry full-coverage map; release binary built with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b rch exec -- cargo build -p fp-frame --example bench_map_cc --release`; local CPU7 best-of-30; mode calls `out.to_numpy()` in the timed window | 12.053 ms | 2.301 ms | **5.24× faster** | ✅ KEEP — applies the Graveyard vectorized-column/region-layout path to the actual residual: `LazyRepeatedSlicesFloat64` now exposes/copies an owned f64 buffer for typed consumers, with a periodic-prefix expansion specialization, so `Series::to_numpy()` no longer boxes through `values()`. Same-session A/B: pre-p0irg FP `numpy` 32.949 ms (0.37× pandas) → borrowed typed buffer 15.393 ms (0.78×) → direct owned f64 2.301 ms (5.24×), a **14.32× FP-side** improvement. Focused guards green: 2 fp-columnar repeated-slice tests, 2 fp-frame periodic Series.map tests, `cargo check -p fp-columnar --all-targets`, `cargo check -p fp-frame --all-targets`, and local clippy for both touched crates. `cargo fmt --check` still fails on broad pre-existing workspace formatting drift outside this lane. |
| Series.combine_first (cmbf/grtx1, bench_combine_cc) | 2M f64 same index, self ~50% NaN, other fills | 7.35 ms local after-row (3.08 ms prior ledger host) | 17.94 ms local; rch hz2 19.38 → 18.33/18.40 ms | **0.41× local (2.44× slower)** | ✅ KEEP modest no-rescan gain — grtx1 stamps the typed identity fast-path output with `from_f64_values_all_valid_unchecked` after proving other all-valid + self-present excludes NaN, avoiding the redundant output validity scan. Same-worker rch hz2 FP-side A/B: 19.375 ms baseline → 18.332/18.400 ms after = ~1.05× faster, focused test green. Still a pandas loss; residual = output allocation/select floor (mimalloc/packed select still needed) |
| Series.combine_first packed validity-word copy-patch (gmn0f, bench_combine_cc) | 2M f64 same index, self ~50% NaN, other fills; CPU7 best-of-50 | 5.915 ms | 15.901 ms | **0.37× (2.69× slower)** | ✅ KEEP FP-side improvement / 🔴 still pandas loss — built with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b rch exec -- cargo build -p fp-frame --example bench_combine_cc --release`; local CPU7 A/B moved FP 18.493 ms baseline → 16.005 ms copy-patch → 15.901 ms packed validity-word copy-patch (1.16× FP-side). Pandas 2.2.3 on the matched workload was 5.915 ms, so this pass is **0 wins / 1 loss / 0 neutral** head-to-head. Focused guards green: 12 `combine_first` fp-frame tests and 31 fp-columnar validity tests. Residual routes deeper to a reusable lower-allocation typed select/builder rather than per-row public `Scalar` materialization. |
| Series.combine_first packed validity-word final rerun (gmn0f/cod-a, bench_combine_cc) | 2M f64 same index, self ~50% NaN, other fills; CPU7 five paired best-of-30 rounds | 7.309 ms | 15.100 ms | **0.48× (2.07× slower)** | ✅ KEEP FP-side improvement / 🔴 still pandas loss — final source built with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a rch exec -- cargo build --release -p fp-frame --example bench_combine_cc`; local CPU7 A/B artifact `/data/projects/.scratch/frankenpandas-cod-a-gmn0f-binaries/combine_first_final_ab_20260620T0652.txt` moved FP best 16.966 ms baseline (`88e791dd`) → 15.100 ms packed-validity candidate (1.12× FP-side; median 17.025 → 15.150 ms, also 1.12×). Pandas 2.2.3 measured 7.309 ms, so this pass is **0 wins / 1 loss / 0 neutral** head-to-head. Final-source guards green: 12 `combine_first` fp-frame tests, 24 fp-columnar validity-mask tests, `cargo check -p fp-frame -p fp-columnar --all-targets`, and local clippy `--no-deps`. Residual remains output allocation / typed-select builder work, not another per-row validity-dispatch trim. |
| Series.combine_first lazy all-valid Float64 select (og9qm, bench_combine_cc) | 2M f64 same index, self ~50% NaN, other all-valid fills; CPU7 best-of-50/20 | construct 6.177 ms; `to_numpy()` 6.075 ms; `values` 6.506 ms | construct 0.0091 ms; typed materialize 2.142 ms; `values()` 30.298 ms | **construct 676× faster; typed materialize 2.84× faster; `values()` 0.21× (4.66× slower)** | ✅ KEEP mixed win/loss — built with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b rch exec -- cargo build -p fp-frame --example bench_combine_cc --release`; the same-index Float64 path now returns a lazy all-valid select tape that materializes the selected f64 buffer only for typed consumers. This flips default construction and typed materialization, so this pass is **2 wins / 1 loss / 0 neutral** head-to-head. Focused guards green: 12 `combine_first` fp-frame tests and 24 fp-columnar validity-mask tests in release mode; `cargo check -p fp-frame -p fp-columnar --all-targets`; lib clippy `--no-deps`; bounded UBS on changed Rust files timed out after 180s with no emitted findings, matching the known fp-frame whole-file scanner backlog. Residual red path is public `values()` boxing every f64 into `Scalar`, so route deeper to typed numeric public consumption / lower-allocation scalar materialization rather than another select-kernel trim. |
| Series.combine_first public `values()` scalar materialization probes (3gsa7) | Same 2M same-index Float64 NaN-fill workload; `bench_combine_cc values`; local CPU7 best-of-50 after `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b rch exec -- cargo build -p fp-frame --example bench_combine_cc --release` on `vmi1153651` | 6.983 ms | baseline 30.444 ms; right-buffer+patch probe 30.601 ms; single-pass push probe 29.999 ms | **0.23× baseline; 0.23× probes (still 4.3× slower)** | ❌ REVERT / NO-SHIP — two lower-allocation scalar materializers failed the keep bar. Probe 1 avoided the intermediate `Vec<f64>` by mapping right scalars then patching valid left slots, but regressed FP 30.444 → 30.601 ms. Probe 2 wrote each `Scalar::Float64` once in a single pass and only reached 29.999 ms, a ~1.5% FP-side move that is within noise and still a pandas loss. Code reverted. Guards after revert: `cargo test -p fp-frame combine_first --lib` 12/12 and `cargo test -p fp-conformance --lib` 1595/1595. This confirms the residual is not fixed by reshuffling enum-boxing loops; route deeper to an API/storage change that avoids public `Vec<Scalar>` for numeric consumers, or to a fundamentally smaller scalar representation. |
| Series.combine_first public `values()` fresh restart verify (3gsa7/cod-b) | Same 2M same-index Float64 NaN-fill workload; `bench_combine_cc values`; release example rebuilt with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b rch exec -- cargo build --release -p fp-frame --example bench_combine_cc` on `vmi1153651`; local CPU7 | 9.852 ms | 31.054 ms | **0.32× (3.15× slower)** | ❌ NO-SHIP — fresh restart confirms the forced public `values()` residual is still a real pandas loss. No code was kept for this lane; prior right-buffer/patch and single-pass scalar-fill probes already failed the keep bar, and another scalar loop reshuffle is unlikely to remove the enum-boxing floor. Route to a smaller public scalar representation, Arrow/numpy-style numeric result buffers, or APIs that preserve typed consumers. |
| Series.combine_first public `values()` BOLD-VERIFY cod-a rerun (3gsa7) | Same 2M same-index Float64 NaN-fill workload; current warm artifact `/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a/release/examples/bench_combine_cc`; local CPU7 best-of-50; pandas 2.2.3 inline comparator | construct 13.416 ms; `values` 13.285 ms; `to_numpy` 14.089 ms | construct 0.00936 ms; typed materialize 5.596 ms; public `values()` 33.529 ms | **construct 1434× faster; typed materialize 2.52× faster; `values()` 0.40× (2.52× slower)** | ❌ NO-SHIP / EVIDENCE-ONLY — `/alien-graveyard` routing again points to vectorized columnar execution, and the typed consumer already wins via the lazy all-valid Float64 select tape. The remaining red surface is the public `Vec<Scalar>` contract: every row must become a 32-byte `Scalar::Float64`, so rearranging the materializer is not a radical enough lever. A parallel scalar-materialization probe was attempted and reverted after compile validation hit disk/time pressure before usable benchmark evidence; no code was kept. Route deeper to a public typed/Arrow-style values view or a smaller scalar ABI, not another enum-boxing loop. |
| Series.update (updf, bench_update_cc) | 2M f64 same index, other ~50% NaN | 3.67 ms | 20.0 ms | **0.18× (5.5× slower)** | ✅ IMPROVED from 59× LOSS (216ms)! killed the pointer-key BTreeMap<&IndexLabel,&Scalar> (O(n log n) + 2 cache misses/row, fp-index pointer-key pathology) + both values() materializes. Typed identity fast path (mirror combine_first, other-first): same-index + all-valid Float64 self + Float64 other ⇒ out[i] = other-present ? other : self. 10.8× FP-side, bit-identical (positional on identical unique index; other-present == label-in-other-&&-not-missing), conformance green (5 tests). Residual 5.5× = output-alloc floor. (pandas update is in-place; fp builds new) |

Unsorted unique Int64 self now reuses the cached `unsorted_unique_int64_positions`; duplicate self keeps the per-call first-occurrence builder. Bit-identical, full conformance green. |

Raw one-binary harness rows are still recorded as dropped evidence (`cod_a_f1ftd_join_inner_str_baseline_20260621.json`: FP CV 15.70%, apparent 11.13×; `cod_a_f1ftd_join_inner_str_pinned_20260621.json`: FP CV 12.33%, apparent 18.13×). The accepted batch-median gate stabilizes both engines below 5% CV; no source change shipped in this pass. |
| Index.get_indexer unsorted unique Utf8 — route through cached resolvers (c90bo) | 1M unsorted unique Utf8 self, 1000 targets, repeated best-of-100 CPU7 | 0.0760 ms | 0.0179 ms | **4.1× faster** | ✅ FIXED — was 744× SLOWER (58.4 ms repeated)! get_indexer (core of reindex/align/join) unsorted non-Int64 path rebuilt `position_map_first_ref` (pointer-key `FxHashMap<&IndexLabel,usize>`) EVERY call; pandas caches its index engine. get_indexer self is unique (pandas raises on dup), so the unsorted fallback now routes through the identity-cached `unique_utf8_positions`/`unique_datetime64_positions` (sfsx4/recbe) before the map. Bit-identical: unique ⇒ first==only==`map.get`; duplicate/other self falls through unchanged. Reflects the repeated-alignment pattern pandas optimizes via engine caching. Full fp-index+fp-frame conformance green; new fp-index test asserts the routed path == map path incl. dup-self fallback. |
| Series.loc[[timestamps]] unique Datetime64 index — identity-cached ns→pos hashtable (recbe) | 2M f64, 1-min-spaced DatetimeIndex, select 1000, best-of-100 CPU7 | 0.8447 ms | 0.0125 ms | **67.6× faster** | ✅ FIXED — was 1173× SLOWER (728.5 ms)! DatetimeIndex is the most common pandas time-series index; `loc[[ts]]` fell to the per-call pointer-key map. `Datetime64(i64)` is ns-backed, so new `Index::unique_datetime64_positions` builds a first-occurrence `FxHashMap<i64, usize>` (keyed on ns) ONCE, cached in process-global `INDEX_DATETIME_POS_LOOKUP_CACHE` keyed by `label_identity` (`Option` value; `None` caches not-all-Datetime64). Warm probe O(k) inline-i64 FxHash; pandas is slow here (844 µs) because it boxes Timestamps. Gated unique + all-Datetime64; duplicate/non-Datetime64 keep the map fallback. Cap 64. Selector order, dup selectors, fail-closed missing, index name preserved. 1 fp-frame `locfast` test + full loc/index conformance green. |
| Series.loc[[labels]] unique Utf8 index — identity-cached String→pos hashtable (sfsx4) | 2M f64, "k%08d" string index, select 1000, best-of-100 CPU7 | 0.3715 ms | 0.0473 ms | **7.9× faster** | ✅ FIXED — was 2029× SLOWER (772.6 ms)! Non-Int64 indexes (very common: `set_index` on a string column) fell to the per-call pointer-key map. New `Index::unique_utf8_positions` builds a first-occurrence `FxHashMap<Box<str>, usize>` ONCE and caches it in process-global `INDEX_UTF8_POS_LOOKUP_CACHE` keyed by `label_identity` (value is `Option`: `None` caches the not-all-Utf8 verdict so the warm path stays O(1) even on non-Utf8 indexes). Warm probe O(k) FxHash on short strings. Gated unique + all-Utf8; duplicate/non-Utf8 keep the map fallback. Cap 16 entries (each holds the index's boxed strings). Selector order, dup selectors, fail-closed missing labels, index name preserved. 1 fp-frame `locfast` test + full loc/index conformance green. |
| Series.loc[[labels]] UNSORTED unique Int64 — identity-cached i64→pos hashtable (2pvdg) | 2M f64, LCG-shuffled unique Int64 index, select 1000, best-of-50 CPU7 | 0.1453 ms | 0.0106 ms | **13.7× faster** | ✅ FIXED — was 5147× SLOWER (747.9 ms)! Unsorted unique Int64 indexes can't binary-search, so they fell to the same per-call pointer-key `FxHashMap<&IndexLabel,Vec<usize>>`. New `Index::unsorted_unique_int64_positions` builds a first-occurrence `i64→position` `FxHashMap` ONCE and caches it in a process-global `INDEX_INT64_POS_LOOKUP_CACHE` keyed by the index's runtime `label_identity` (same identity-cache pattern as `INDEX_LABEL_EQUALITY_CACHE`; clone/rename preserve identity + labels, so sharing is sound). Warm probe is O(k) inline-i64 FxHash — beats even the sorted binary-search path (10.6 µs vs 86.5 µs) because binary search over 2M chases cache lines per level. Gated all-Int64 + unique + NOT sorted; sorted keeps binary search, duplicate/non-Int64 keep the map fallback. Selector order, dup selectors, fail-closed missing labels, index name preserved. 1 fp-frame `locfast` + 1 fp-index gating test + full loc/index conformance green. |

New `Index::sorted_unique_int64_positions` builds+caches the typed `int64_view` (`&[i64]`) ONCE in the index's `int64_typed` OnceLock, then binary-searches each requested label O(k log n). Series.loc + DataFrame.loc route strictly-ascending materialized Int64 indexes through it, replacing the per-call pointer-key `FxHashMap<&IndexLabel,Vec<usize>>` over the WHOLE index (O(n) + 2M tiny Vec allocs/call). pandas 137.1 µs vs fp 86.5 µs (self-verified, taskset -c 7). Distinct from the reverted `locsrt` get_loc path (which only hit LAZY-int64 backings); this caches the materialized Vec→typed view. Selector order, duplicate selectors, fail-closed missing labels, index name all preserved; duplicate/unsorted indexes keep the map fallback. 2 `locfast` tests + full loc/index conformance green (3081 passed; the 4 unrelated acosh/arccosh golden + groupby_prod failures are pre-existing/host-libm, not this lever). |

Honest no-ship: would flatter the bench, not production. |

| RangeIndex.to_flat_index lazy Int64 backing BOLD-VERIFY (uza04.167/cod-b) | 1M-label unit, strided, and descending `RangeIndex` with name, each operation calls `to_flat_index()` then one midpoint `get_loc`; pandas 2.2.3 local best-of-200 vs `bench_range_setops range_to_flat_index` | unit 0.000301 ms / strided 0.000321 ms / descending 0.000310 ms | local unit 0.000170 ms / strided 0.000170 ms / descending 0.000151 ms | **1.77× / 1.89× / 2.05× faster** | ✅ VERIFIED KEEP — current `RangeIndex::to_flat_index` already delegates to `Index::from_range`, preserves the name, and keeps typed lazy Int64 backing with `labels.materialized` empty; pandas returns the same lazy `RangeIndex`, but FP's constructor+lookup boundary is still faster on this same-host microbench. No production code was changed; added only the benchmark mode.

| RangeIndex reindex direct target scan BOLD-VERIFY (wnhuw/cod-b) | 1M-label `RangeIndex(0, 3n, 3)` reindexed against a same-step target with half overlap / half misses, plus descending source+target; pandas 2.2.3 local `RangeIndex.reindex(target)` best-of-100 vs `bench_range_setops range_reindex`; warm `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`. | ascending 11.207965 ms / descending 12.007399 ms | current ascending 0.808061 ms / descending 0.805145 ms; benchmark-only old target-values shape 9.698274 ms / 10.028259 ms | **ascending 13.87× / descending 14.91× faster than pandas; FP-side 12.00× / 12.46× faster than old target-values allocation shape** | ✅ VERIFIED EXISTING WIN — current `RangeIndex::reindex` already computes the indexer directly from target arithmetic (`range_target_indexer` for affine targets, `value_at(position)` fallback otherwise) and returns `target.clone()` without allocating `target.values()` first. The added benchmark mode makes the stale-open `wnhuw` child reproducible; no production code change was needed and no rollback candidate was kept. |
| RangeIndex splice outputs BOLD-VERIFY (uza04.169/cod-b) | 1M-label `RangeIndex(0, n*3, 3)` plus right `RangeIndex(n*5, n*7, 2)`, construction+`len()` for middle `insert(-7)`, `append`, and middle `delete`; pandas 2.2.3 local best-of-20 vs `bench_range_setops range_splice_outputs` | insert 0.193427 ms / append 0.838418 ms / delete 0.192084 ms | local final insert 0.628560 ms / append 0.000120 ms / delete 0.000170 ms; pre-lazy materialized candidate was insert 0.577594 ms / append 1.342152 ms / delete 0.706188 ms | **insert 0.31× pandas (3.25× slower residual) / append 6,987× faster / delete 1,130× faster** | ✅ PARTIAL KEEP — `append` and middle `delete` now return lazy two-affine Int64 `Index` outputs, preserving name and typed/non-materialized backing while avoiding full `Vec<i64>` construction. `insert` still needs a three-segment representation for the benchmark shape and remains materialized, so it is recorded as a residual pandas gap rather than hidden. The generic two-affine constructor does not predeclare uniqueness, so overlapping `append` keeps duplicate semantics; `delete` uses the known-unique two-run path. Guards: `cargo test -p fp-index range_index_splice --release`, `cargo check -p fp-index --all-targets`, `cargo clippy -p fp-index --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt -p fp-index --check`, and UBS on changed fp-index files. |

Conformance smoke passed its stable-report test; the worker-local pandas oracle checkout was absent, so the oracle-discovery smoke skipped that lookup as designed.

### Win: groupby std/var generic-key clone-free counters
The `uza04.202` lever removes per-group `Vec<Scalar>` materialization from generic-key
`groupby_agg(Var|Std)` and keeps two compact numeric passes over the original Float64
values. Against pandas 2.2.3 / numpy 2.4.3 on the realistic UTF8-key workload
(`sort=True`, 1000 keys, NaN every 37th row), all six accepted rows beat pandas:
1.29x-1.34x at 100k, 1.22x-1.23x at 1M, and 1.30x-1.34x at 2M after the longer
20-iteration/sample rerun stabilized the large rows. Geomean across accepted rows:
1.285x faster. No revert: the lever has focused conformance coverage, stable golden
digests, and no accepted slower/neutral release row.

### Win: RangeIndex.asof closed-form scalar lookup
The `jlv2o` lever changes ascending `RangeIndex::asof(Int64)` from direct label scanning
to `searchsorted(..., "right") - 1` over the affine `(start, stop, step)` witness.
Focused Criterion on the local host measured 4,096-probe batches at 60.42 µs (100k rows)
and 65.52 µs (1M rows). The matching pandas 2.2.3 public scalar API loop measured
232.02 ms and 1,050.29 ms respectively, with pandas CV below 5%. No revert: the lever
is both behavior-guarded and decisively faster than pandas on the targeted workload.
Artifacts: `artifacts/bench/gauntlet_cod_b_range_asof_vs_pandas.json`,
`artifacts/bench/gauntlet_cod_b_range_asof_criterion_local.txt`, and
`artifacts/bench/gauntlet_cod_b_range_asof_pandas.json`.

### Win: RangeIndex bulk indexers arithmetic lattice
The `uza04.159` lever keeps the public `get_loc` error contract intact while moving bulk
indexers onto the affine witness: `get_indexer`/`get_indexer_non_unique` reuse one source
length and a bounded i64 membership check, and `reindex(RangeIndex)` emits the indexer by
source-position arithmetic when the target lies on the source lattice. The old `29u49`
exception-allocation fix was a real FP-side improvement but still left accepted pandas
losses; this follow-up closes the vectorized RangeIndex gap.

Same-host local head-to-head against pandas 2.2.3 now wins all accepted rows: 100k
miss-heavy `get_indexer` is 2.64x faster (0.777 ms pandas p50 vs 0.295 ms FP Criterion
mean), 1M miss-heavy `get_indexer` is 3.61x faster, 100k all-miss `reindex` is 36.1x
faster, and 1M all-miss `reindex` is 51.5x faster. Same-worker `rch` Criterion on `ovh-b`
also proved the lever delta against the pre-change path: `get_indexer` improved 4.0x at
both 100k and 1M targets, while all-miss `reindex` improved 75.7x at 100k and 32.2x at
1M. No revert: the lever is behavior-guarded by the RangeIndex sweep, including
descending ranges, partial lattices, all-miss targets, and full-width i64 arithmetic.

### Win: clone-free generic `groupby.sum`/`prod` on Utf8 keys (br-frankenpandas-uza04.193)
**VERIFIED after code-first commit.** The implementation had already landed and was reset
open because batch proof was pending. Current cod-b verification rebuilt `fp-groupby` per-crate:
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b rch exec -- cargo build --release -p fp-groupby --bin groupby-bench`
passed on worker `hz2`, then the local retrieved release binary was run pinned to CPU 7.

Head-to-head fixture: 1,000,000 rows, 1,000 Utf8 groups, Float64 values, every 37th
value missing, `sort=True`. Fair pandas Series-vs-Series batches on pandas 2.2.3 were
`sum` p50 32.946 ms (CV 3.17%) and `prod` p50 32.988 ms (CV 3.51%). FP public
`groupby_sum` batches were 15.180, 15.141, 15.226, 15.000, 14.930 ms (p50
15.141 ms, CV ~0.7%). FP public `groupby_prod` batches were 13.001, 13.099,
12.909, 12.995, 13.149 ms (p50 13.001 ms, CV <1%). Verdict: **2.18x faster
than pandas for sum** and **2.54x faster than pandas for prod**. The public
`sum` and dispatcher alias `agg-sum` produce the same golden digest:
`7fb4fd07f6f8bdf2` (`out_rows=1000`).

Conformance guards:
`rch exec -- cargo test -p fp-groupby groupby_agg_sum_matches_dedicated_sum --release`,
`groupby_agg_sum_prod_utf8_keys_stream_integer_slots`,
`groupby_agg_sum_prod_float64_utf8_keys_stream_counters_2qb1i`,
`groupby_agg_sum_prod_bool_and_prod_overflow_preserve_fallbacks`, and
`groupby_agg_sum_prod_timedelta_fallback_preserved_2qb1i` all passed. Semantics
preserved: sorted and first-seen output order, null skipping, all-missing defaults,
Bool/Int64 dtype preservation, product overflow f64 fallback, Float64 folds, and
Timedelta fallback routing. `perf stat` attribution remained blocked by
`perf_event_paranoid=4`.

### Win: clone-free generic `groupby.first`/`last` on Utf8 keys (br-frankenpandas-uza04.192)
**VERIFIED after code-first commit.** The implementation had already landed and was reset
open because batch proof was pending. Current cod-a verification built `fp-groupby` per-crate:
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a rch exec -- cargo build --release -p fp-groupby --bin groupby-bench`
passed with rch local fallback when the worker fleet had no admissible build slots; the
focused release tests then ran remotely on `hz2`.

Head-to-head fixture: 1,000,000 rows, 1,000 Utf8 groups, Float64 values, every 37th
value missing, `sort=True`, pandas 2.2.3 / numpy 2.4.3. Batched pandas p50s were
`first` 42.290 ms and `last` 42.085 ms. FP public batches were:
`first` 14.598, 13.889, 15.309, 14.497, 13.967 ms (p50 14.497 ms), and
`last` 18.385, 18.850, 18.045, 19.782, 18.137 ms (p50 18.385 ms). Verdict:
**2.92x faster than pandas for first** and **2.29x faster than pandas for last**.
Golden digests on the same fixture are `a8c2c037ffb85c88` for first and
`d373b7337998d544` for last.

Conformance guards:
`rch exec -- cargo test --release -p fp-groupby groupby_first -- --nocapture`
passed 4/4 focused release tests, including UTF8-key sorted/first-seen order,
skip-missing/all-missing behavior, object scalar preservation, and dense Int64 oracle
coverage. `rch exec -- cargo test --release -p fp-groupby groupby_last -- --nocapture`
passed the focused last release guard. Semantics preserved: null skipping, all-missing
NaN output, selected scalar identity for object groups, sorted output order, and
first-seen order fallback.

### Win: clone-free generic `groupby.count`/`size` on Utf8 keys (br-frankenpandas-uza04.187)
**VERIFIED after code-first commit.** The implementation had already landed and was reset
open because batch proof was pending. Current cod-a verification built `fp-groupby` per-crate:
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a rch exec -- cargo build --release -p fp-groupby --bin groupby-bench`
passed on worker `ovh-b`, then the retrieved release binary was used for local timings.

Head-to-head fixture: 1,000,000 rows, 1,000 Utf8 groups, Float64 values, every 37th
value missing, `sort=True`, pandas 2.2.3 / numpy 2.4.3. Batched pandas p50s were
`count` 40.566 ms and `size` 45.113 ms. FP public batches were:
`count` 15.024, 20.496, 16.307, 14.301, 16.462 ms (p50 16.307 ms), and
`size` 14.055, 14.669, 16.064, 16.483, 16.341 ms (p50 16.064 ms). Verdict:
**2.49x faster than pandas for count** and **2.81x faster than pandas for size**.
Golden digests on the same fixture are `1e555b43a73656c1` for count and
`c6ccd2e318a736dd` for size.

Conformance guards:
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a rch exec -- cargo test --release -p fp-groupby groupby_count -- --nocapture`
passed 4/4 focused release tests, including the Utf8 count/size null/order guard.
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a rch exec -- cargo test --release -p fp-groupby groupby_size -- --nocapture`
passed 3/3 focused release tests. Semantics preserved: `count` skips missing
values, `size` includes missing values, sorted output order is stable, and the
first-seen `sort=false` contract remains covered by the shared guard.

### Gap: shift/concat/ffill structural — column-rebuild vs in-place (historically 6.6–24× slower)
**ffill (2M f64, ~10% NaN) originally confirmed the pattern: 18.43 ms vs pandas 2.79 ms = 6.6× slower.**
ffill had a typed `as_f64_slice_with_validity` path but still rebuilt every output slot and
re-initialized validity. skw2c fixes the no-limit Float64 case by extracting invalid runs from
packed validity words, bulk-copying the f64 buffer, and filling only missing spans; that flips
ffill to 2.371 ms vs pandas 3.340 ms = 1.41× faster. concat construction is no longer the
active rebuild-class loss: cod-a's Int64 chunk tape now stores all-valid source spans instead
of allocating a fresh destination buffer, flipping `ignore_index=True` construction to
0.000361 ms vs pandas 0.851 ms = 2,358× faster. xgrv3 also narrows one Float64 concat follow-on
lane: existing concat chunks plus the new `as_f64_slice()` bridge make `pd.concat(...).sum()`'s
fp analogue 4.824 ms vs pandas 8.055 ms = 1.67× faster. Forced materialization still pays the
typed/scalar buffer cost when a downstream consumer asks for a contiguous slice or `values()`,
but construction itself now has the broader chunk/view model this section called for.

fp shift/concat rebuild a whole new typed Column (`as_f64/i64_slice` materializes the typed
buffer for `from_values`-built columns, then `from_f64/i64_values` re-inits validity, then
`Series::new`) — multiple O(n) passes — whereas pandas shift/concat is ~one numpy memmove/
concatenate. The typed levers are NOT regressions (≥ old fp Scalar rebuild) so kept, but the
WHOLE-COLUMN-REBUILD construction is fp's structural disadvantage on these ops. INSIGHT: the
typed-slice levers win big when typed access unlocks a cheaper ALGORITHM (FxHash dedup, dense
value_counts, Welford std → 2–11× wins) but only break even (then lose on construction
overhead) for ops that merely rebuild the column (shift/concat). Kernel-level fix needed.

### Fixed: concat Int64 construction chunk tape (24× loss → 2,358× win)
pandas `pd.concat` of Int64 series ≈ a single `np.concatenate` (flat int64 memcpy, 281µs/1M).
fp's path has structural overhead: per-series `as_i64_slice` (may materialize the typed
buffer from the Scalars variant on first call), `extend_from_slice` into a fresh Vec<i64>,
`Column::from_i64_values` (validity init), then `Series::new`. The typed lever is NOT a
regression (≥ the old Scalar concat, bit-transparent) so not reverted, but concat is fp's
weakest realistic op. FIX ATTEMPT (REVERTED): collect each typed slice ONCE via `Option::collect` instead of the
double `as_i64_slice` (probe + extend). Built+measured: **6.81 → 6.49 ms (~5%, immaterial)**
— the double-call was NOT the bottleneck. Reverted (working-tree only).

**ROOT CAUSE PINNED (gauntlet experiment, hypothesis tested + REFUTED).** Two earlier guesses
(Scalars-backing materialization; validity init) were both wrong. The bench now measures
three variants of the 1M/k=8 concat:
- `scalars_backed` (parts via `from_values`, as_i64_slice→None, Scalar fallback path): **6.58 ms**
- `typed_backed` (parts via `from_i64_values`, as_i64_slice→Some, typed Int64 path): **6.63 ms**
- `direct_build` (NO concat at all — just `from_i64_values(flat.clone()) + Series::new` of a
  pre-flattened 1M Vec): **6.69 ms**
All three are equal. So: (a) the typed-vs-Scalar backing is irrelevant → **the typed concat
lever (tbrtu) is ~0-gain** (kept only because it's bit-transparent and ≥ the Scalar path,
not because it helps); (b) the concat iteration/extend is only ~0.4 ms; (c) **the entire cost
is RESULT CONSTRUCTION** — allocating + filling a fresh 8 MB `Vec<i64>` (clone + first-touch
page faults) for the output column. `Index::new_known_unique_int64_unit_range`, `Series::new`,
and `ValidityMask::all_valid` are all verified O(1) (affine labels + preset caches; empty
words vec; len-only check). pandas' `np.concatenate` (281µs) wins via numpy's optimized
allocator/memcpy (no per-page first-touch cost, buffer reuse).

**FIX CONFIRMED — pooling global allocator (mimalloc) recovers 13×.** The predicted
allocator fix was tested: `bench_concat_mimalloc` runs the identical 1M/k=8 concat with
mimalloc as `#[global_allocator]`. Result: **6.69 ms (system glibc malloc) → 0.52 ms
(mimalloc) = 12.9× faster.** That flips concat from **24× slower than pandas → 1.86× slower**
(0.52 ms vs pandas 0.28 ms). So the rebuild-class "structural loss" was ~93% the glibc
malloc large-allocation cost (mmap threshold → fresh mmap + kernel zero-fill + first-touch
faults per call), NOT anything in fp's column/index/Series logic. **This is the single
highest-leverage lever found in the gauntlet**: a pooling global allocator should recover a
large fraction of concat/shift/ffill (all rebuild-class, all allocation-bound) at once,
workspace-wide. ACTION: adopt mimalloc/jemalloc as the global allocator for the user-facing
binary (fp-python cdylib) + benchmark harnesses — a workspace coordination decision (interacts
with fp-groupby/fp-join arena allocators), filed as a high-priority bead, not imposed
unilaterally. Dead ends still recorded: typed-backing and validity-init tweaks don't help;
the lever is the allocator, not the column build.

**CURRENT FIX — lazy Int64 chunk tape removes the construction allocation.** cod-a's follow-up
keeps concat's source `Arc<[i64]>` buffers as `(arc, start, len)` spans in
`LazyAllValidInt64Chunks`, and only builds the flat `Vec<i64>` when a consumer asks for a
typed slice or public scalar values. The same workload now measures **0.000361 ms FP vs
0.851 ms pandas = 2,358× faster** in the normal release harness; the old same-binary
materialized direct build remains **6.249 ms**, so the delta is the eliminated output
allocation/page-touch floor rather than allocator noise. Mimalloc remains useful for consumers
that force materialization, but concat construction itself is no longer a loss class.

**GENERALIZES (measured) — mimalloc helps the whole rebuild-class, not just concat.** Ran the
same shift/ffill workloads under mimalloc (`bench_rebuild_mimalloc`): shift 9.01 → 3.98 ms
(2.3×, gap 12× → 5.4×), ffill 18.43 → 6.62 ms (2.8×, gap 6.6× → 2.4×). Smaller than concat's
13× because concat is ~93% allocation while shift/ffill also do a full per-element transform
pass (allocation is ~half their cost) — so the allocator fixes the alloc half and the rebuild
floor remains. Net: a pooling global allocator is a clear win across all three rebuild-class
losses (concat 13×, ffill 2.8×, shift 2.3×), strongest where allocation dominates. Strengthens
bead 3nah5 — `#[global_allocator]` is SAFE Rust (no unsafe), so unlike the AVX2 SIMD lever it
is compatible with this codebase; only the workspace-coordination (arena interaction, re-
baselining) blocks unilateral adoption.

**dfcv8 follow-up — shift rebuild scan eliminated, ffill still residual.** Current-source
`rch exec -- cargo build --release -p fp-frame --example bench_shift --example bench_ffill
--example bench_rebuild_mimalloc` plus local release-binary timings show `shift` now wins in
the intended mimalloc boundary mode: 0.673 ms vs pandas 0.943 ms = 1.40× faster. The plain
glibc allocator path remains a loss (1.47 ms vs pandas 0.943 ms = 0.64×), so the honest
verdict is "keep with allocator boundary." `ffill` improves modestly but remains behind:
6.17 ms vs pandas 3.221 ms = 0.52×. `perf stat` profiling was attempted but blocked by
`/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid=4`; timing, golden digests, conformance, and UBS are
the accepted proof for this narrow lever.

**skw2c follow-up — ffill validity-run path flips the gap.** Current-source
`rch exec -- cargo build --release -p fp-frame --example bench_rebuild_mimalloc` plus local
`taskset -c 7` timings show `ffill` at 2.371 ms vs pandas 3.340 ms = 1.41× faster after the
packed validity-run visitor. Same-run before for the mimalloc boundary was 5.745 ms, so the
lever is a 2.42× FP-side win. `perf stat` is still blocked by `perf_event_paranoid=4`; focused
`fp-columnar` and `fp-frame` tests cover the new run visitor and leading-null pandas semantics.

**ADOPTION VERIFY (cod-a exact-parent A/B).** Compared the `250bfbf2^` parent binary against
`250bfbf2` (`release-perf`, local executable after `rch` build proof; both pinned with
`taskset -c 7`). Broad `fp-bench` smoke found strong allocator wins where result materialization
dominates: `cumsum` 51.48 → 17.99 ms (2.86×), `value_counts` 71.32 → 36.20 ms (1.97×),
`filter_bool_mask` 34.67 → 15.93 ms (2.18×), `loc_labels` 0.332 → 0.232 ms (1.43×), and
`join_outer` 5.59 → 1.67 ms (3.35×). Neutral controls: `drop_duplicates` +3.5%,
`rolling_mean_w10` -4.3%, `rolling_std_w50` +0.5%, `ewm_mean` +0.1%, `join_inner` -8.4%,
and `str_value_counts` +2.5% (several high-CV, not release proof). Apparent regressions were
rerun in five paired batches and did not clear the rollback bar: `groupby_mean_float64` +1.7%,
`groupby_mean_str` +1.7%, `groupby_transform_mean` +4.1%, `csv_write` +4.8%. Verdict:
KEEP. No confirmed regression above 5%; no semantic code path changed.

### Win: clone-free generic `groupby.mean` on Utf8 keys (br-frankenpandas-uza04.189) — 2.80x vs pandas
**VERIFIED after code-first commit.** The implementation landed earlier in
`1f5681ec` and was left open pending honest vs-pandas proof. Current cod-a
verification rebuilt `fp-groupby` per-crate with
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a`:
`rch exec -- cargo build -p fp-groupby --profile release-perf --bin groupby-bench`
passed on worker `hz2`; local release-perf binary was then rebuilt because RCH
retrieved only metadata, not the runnable bench executable.

Head-to-head fixture: 1,000,000 rows, 1,000 Utf8 groups (`key_000000`...),
Float64 values, every 37th value missing, `sort=True`. FP command:
`taskset -c 7 groupby-bench --agg mean --key-kind utf8 --value-kind float64
--rows 1000000 --key-cardinality 1000`. Long FP batches were 14.961, 14.711,
13.514 ms/op (median 14.711 ms). Matching pandas 2.2.3 fixture batches were
40.998, 41.270, 41.230, 40.817, 42.377 ms/op (median 41.230 ms, batch CV
1.47%). Verdict: **41.230 / 14.711 = 2.80x faster than pandas** (2.73x even
against FP's slowest long batch). Golden digest:
`ca3d3a8a70a57dd9` for the FP output (`out_rows=1000`).

Conformance guard:
`rch exec -- cargo test -p fp-groupby groupby_mean_utf8_counter_path_preserves_null_and_order_semantics --release`
passed on worker `vmi1149989` (1 passed, 0 failed). Semantics preserved: null
skipping, sorted output order, and first-seen `sort=false` ordering are covered
by the focused guard. This closes the pending code-first bead as a real measured
win. Remaining Utf8 groupby loss is narrower: `groupby.sum` over Utf8 keys is
still tracked separately; do not generalize this mean win to that row.

**Route ledger for this pass.** `vs_pandas_harness.py` routing with the current
cod-a `fp-bench` binary found many high-CV rows and one valid owner-conflicting
loss. Dropped as non-evidence: dataframe_ops 100k/1M all workloads; IO
`csv_read`/`csv_write` at 100k; `groupby_mean_str` 100k/1M; strings
`str_value_counts`/`str_groupby_sum` 1M; `range_index_take_arithmetic` 100k/1M;
`reindex` 100k/1M. Valid rows: `groupby_transform_mean_str` 1M was already a
win at 3.65x; `affine_index_take_arithmetic` 100k was a real loss at 0.879x
(FP 6.956 ms, pandas 6.112 ms), but it maps to active `cc` `Index::take`
work and cod-b RangeIndex children, so cod-a did not edit that surface. Current
valid route ratio: **2 wins / 1 loss / 0 neutral**, with the loss routed to
existing index owners.

### Reverted/no-ship: Series add/mul same-index deeper probes (38xpk)

Target: public `Series::add` / `Series::mul`, 2M Float64 same Int64 index,
best-of-30 release benchmark via `bench_binop_cc`; pandas oracle is pandas 2.2.3.
Saved FP baseline for this pass: **add 16.563 ms, mul 16.361 ms, gt 1.054 ms**.
Initial pandas sanity: **add 1.686 ms, mul 1.659 ms, gt 0.946 ms**. Current
baseline status remains a red loss, about **0.10x pandas** for add/mul.

**FIX ATTEMPT (REVERTED): zero-fill removal in `apply_f64_slices_nan_tracked`.**
The allocator-style hypothesis was that `Vec::with_capacity` plus `push`
would skip the output `vec![0.0; len]` initialization and remove wasted memory
bandwidth. Focused conformance stayed green:
`fp-columnar apply_f64_slices_matches_fn_pointer_per_element_f64simd --release`
and `fp-columnar aligned_binary_f64_same_positions_matches_general_path_for_all_ops_with_nan_inf --release`
both passed on `rch` hz2; golden checksums were unchanged (`add=7f49e78bce11291f`,
`mul=151f386c9e49d432`). Measurement rejected it: columnar add regressed
**2.945 -> 4.099 ms** while columnar mul improved **4.468 -> 3.814 ms**; public
Series add/mul both regressed **16.563/16.361 -> 17.595/17.546 ms**. Versus
pandas, the candidate was only **0.096x add / 0.095x mul**. Conclusion: the
push-based construction likely blocked the better store/vectorization shape;
do not retry push-output construction for this hot f64 binary kernel without
new codegen evidence.

**FIX ATTEMPT (REVERTED): discard-ledger fast return for public arithmetic.**
The public wrappers already disable semantic witnesses, so the next hypothesis
was to skip runtime decision-record allocation for throwaway ledgers while
preserving strict/hardened actions. Focused checks were green before timing:
`fp-runtime discard_audit_ledger_preserves_policy_actions_without_records_38xpk --release`
passed on hz2, `fp-frame series_add_emits_alignment_semantic_witness_tn6qb3 --release`
passed on vmi1149989, and `fp-frame series_add_aligns_on_union_index --release`
passed on hz2. Measurement rejected it decisively. Candidate samples:
**add 31.745 / 31.466 / 31.486 ms**, **mul 16.208 / 30.587 / 31.492 ms**,
**gt 0.974 / 1.113 / 1.098 ms**. Same-session pandas sanity improved to
**add 1.436 ms, mul 1.367 ms, gt 0.771 ms**, so the candidate fell to about
**0.046x add** and at best **0.084x mul** versus pandas, with repeated mul
samples near **0.043x**. Conclusion: the extra branch/API shape perturbed
codegen enough to swamp the small record-allocation saving; do not add a
discard-audit fast path to `EvidenceLedger` for public arithmetic without a
fresh same-worker win.

38xpk verdict: **0 wins / 2 losses / 0 neutral** this pass. Both losses were
measured, reverted before commit, and routed to deeper structural work
(output construction / owned-column materialization), not another semantic
witness or safe portable-SIMD retry.

### Kept: Series add/mul same-index disjoint morsel sweep (tycz7)

Target: public `Series::add` / `Series::mul`, 2M Float64 same Int64 index,
best-of-50 release benchmark via `bench_binop_cc`; pandas oracle is pandas 2.2.3.
The lever came from the graveyard/vectorized-execution playbook: split the large
`apply_f64_slices_nan_tracked` output buffer into disjoint scoped thread morsels instead
of one monolithic arithmetic sweep, capped at 8 workers and gated to `len >= 1 << 20`.
No unsafe code and no semantic shortcut.

Isomorphism proof: the same per-position helper computes each output element; the
partition is contiguous and disjoint, so every index is written exactly once in the same
location. The only reductions are `input_nan |= chunk_input_nan` and
`output_nan |= chunk_output_nan`, which are associative/commutative booleans. Output order,
NaN/inf behavior, and witness booleans are unchanged. Focused guard
`apply_f64_slices_parallel_matches_serial_nan_tracking` compares every output bit against
the serial helper with both input-NaN and output-NaN cases.

Same-worker FP baseline before the lever, pinned CPU 7: **add 16.558 ms, mul 16.403 ms,
gt 0.996 ms**. Exact-code pinned best-of-50 confirmation samples after the final
`expect` cleanup: add **2.534 / 2.949 / 2.764 ms**, mul **2.848 / 2.912 / 2.915 ms**,
gt **0.984 / 1.039 / 1.028 ms**; use the conservative middle sample as the release row.
That is about **6.0x faster add**, **5.6x faster mul**, and neutral/no-regression for gt
inside FrankenPandas. Matching pinned pandas 2.2.3 best-of-50: **add 2.784 ms,
mul 2.798 ms, gt 2.182 ms**. Pinned head-to-head ratio (pandas / FP): **add 1.01x
neutral, mul 0.96x neutral, gt 2.12x win**. Exact-code unpinned FP rerun
**add 3.000 ms, mul 2.892 ms, gt 1.365 ms** versus saved unpinned pandas
**add 2.650 ms, mul 3.449 ms, gt 3.181 ms** gives **add 0.88x loss, mul 1.19x win,
gt 2.33x win**. Verdict at a 5% threshold: pinned **1 win / 0 losses / 2 neutral**;
unpinned **2 wins / 1 loss / 0 neutral**. KEEP: add/mul had huge same-worker FP-side
gains and no focused conformance regression, but add remains threshold-sensitive rather
than a durable pandas win.

Verification: `rch exec -- cargo build --release -p fp-frame --example bench_binop_cc`,
`rch exec -- cargo check -p fp-columnar --all-targets`, `rch exec -- cargo clippy
-p fp-columnar --all-targets -- -D warnings`, and focused conformance tests for the
new helper plus `aligned_binary_f64_same_positions_matches_general_path_for_all_ops_with_nan_inf`,
`apply_f64_slices_matches_fn_pointer_per_element_f64simd`,
`series_add_emits_alignment_semantic_witness_tn6qb3`, and
`series_add_aligns_on_union_index` all passed. `perf stat` was attempted for hardware
counters but blocked by `perf_event_paranoid=4`, so this row uses timing proof only.

### Kept: Series add/mul same-index owned hot Float64 output (cod-b 2026-06-27)

Target: same public row as above, `Series::add` / `Series::mul`, 2M all-valid
Float64 values on equal Int64 indexes, measured with `bench_binop_cc` best-of-50/80
on pinned CPU 7. Route: the biggest remaining documented arithmetic gap was no
longer the arithmetic sweep itself, but the materialization boundary after the
same-index Float64 kernel. The no-output-NaN branch already proves the output is
all-valid; it was still feeding the hot result `Vec<f64>` through the Arc-slice
constructor. The new lever stamps that exact proven all-valid buffer through the
owned lazy Float64 backing (`LazyAllValidFloat64Vec`), matching the existing unary
hot-output pattern and avoiding the cold `Arc<[f64]>` conversion copy. This came
from the graveyard/vectorized-execution evidence: keep cache-hot vector outputs
inside a vectorized/morsel pipeline instead of re-materializing at a boundary.

Isomorphism proof: the arithmetic sweep, input-NaN gate, output-NaN gate, and
fallbacks are unchanged. The new constructor is reached only when
`!input_nan && !output_nan`; therefore every output slot is valid and contains the
same `f64` bit pattern that the old all-valid constructor received. The storage
variant changes from Arc-slice lazy all-valid to owned-Vec lazy all-valid, both
surface through the same `as_f64_slice`/`values()` contracts and defer scalar
materialization. A focused guard now asserts the same-index all-valid route keeps
the owned lazy buffer without populating scalar values.

Same-worktree FP baseline before the lever, `rch exec -- cargo build --release
-p fp-frame --example bench_binop_cc` (local fallback, same target dir) then
`taskset -c 7`: best-of-50 samples **add 6.912 / 6.346 / 6.640 ms**, **mul
6.378 / 6.369 / 6.403 ms**, **gt 2.431 / 2.549 / 2.482 ms**. Candidate
best-of-50 samples after the lever: **add 3.637 / 4.617 / 4.139 ms**, **mul
3.175 / 4.080 / 4.423 ms**, **gt 1.987 / 2.618 / 2.469 ms**. Candidate
best-of-80 confirmation: **add 3.517 ms, mul 3.710 ms, gt 1.915 ms**. Fresh
pandas 2.2.3 best-of-80 on the same pinned CPU: **add 4.582 ms, mul 4.610 ms,
gt 3.514 ms**. Head-to-head ratio (pandas / FP): **add 1.30x**, **mul 1.24x**,
**gt 1.83x**. FP-side delta from the median best-of-50 baseline to the best-of-80
confirmation: **1.89x faster add**, **1.72x faster mul**. KEEP.

Verification: `cargo fmt -p fp-columnar --check` passed; full workspace
`cargo fmt --check` is still red on unrelated pre-existing formatting drift in
`fp-frame`/`fp-index`/`fp-join`, so this pass did not format peer-owned files.
`rch exec -- cargo check -p fp-columnar --all-targets` and `rch exec -- cargo
clippy -p fp-columnar --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed on `hz2`.
Focused guards passed: `fp-columnar aligned_binary_f64_same_positions --release`,
`fp-columnar apply_f64_slices_parallel_matches_serial_nan_tracking --release`,
`fp-frame series_add_emits_alignment_semantic_witness_tn6qb3 --release`, and
`fp-frame series_add_aligns_on_union_index --release`. The requested spelling
`rch exec -- cargo bench --release -p fp-columnar --no-run` was tried and Cargo
rejected `--release` for `bench`; the valid per-crate bench profile commands
`rch exec -- cargo bench -p fp-columnar --no-run` and `rch exec -- cargo bench
-p fp-columnar` both completed successfully. `rch exec -- cargo test -p
fp-conformance --release` passed (1596 unit tests plus integration/doc tests).

### Win: max/min 8-lane chunked accumulator (simdmx) — gap 5×→1.7×
**FIXED (mostly).** `Series.max/min` Int64 now use an 8-lane chunked accumulator
(`i64_slice_max_simd`/`i64_slice_min_simd`): process 8 independent `max`/`min` lanes per
step, then reduce. This breaks the serial dependency chain of `iter().max()` that LLVM
refused to vectorize, exposing instruction-level parallelism (and SIMD where the target
allows). Built+measured 2M int64: **max 1.15 → 0.357 ms (3.2×), min 1.17 → 0.424 ms (2.8×)**,
shrinking the pandas gap from ~5× to 1.63×/1.86×. BIT-IDENTICAL (integer max/min are
associative + commutative, so lane reordering can't change the result) — conformance green
(reductions_typed_conformance 3/3, 11 reduction lib tests pass), no golden regen. KEPT.
Remaining ~1.7× to numpy is the AVX2/AVX512 i64-max instruction the baseline build doesn't
emit.

**FIX ATTEMPT (REVERTED): explicit AVX2 via `#[target_feature(enable="avx2")]`.** Added an
`unsafe` AVX2-compiled wrapper (`i64_max_avx2`/`i64_min_avx2` calling an `#[inline(always)]`
core) + runtime `is_x86_feature_detected!("avx2")` dispatch with a portable fallback. Build
FAILED: this clean-room **safe-Rust** port denies `unsafe` (build lint: "declaration of an
unsafe function" / "usage of an unsafe block" → `could not compile fp-frame`). Reverted.

**FIX ATTEMPT (REVERTED, br-frankenpandas-uza04.207): safe portable-SIMD reductions.**
Corpus routing pointed at vectorized execution (`std::simd` kernels for aggregations) as the
right radical lever, and `fp-frame` already enables `portable_simd`. Built through `rch` on
`hz2` with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`, then timed
the retrieved release binary locally against pandas 2.2.3 / numpy 2.4.3. Current manual
8-lane baseline rerun: **max 0.352 ms, min 0.359 ms**; paired pandas best:
**max 0.203 ms, min 0.205 ms** (still a loss at ~0.57×/0.57×). Replacing the helper with
safe `std::simd::Simd<i64, 8>` regressed to **max 0.811 ms, min 0.811 ms**; `Simd<i64, 4>`
regressed further to **max 1.087 ms, min 1.108 ms**. Both variants were reverted before
landing. CONCLUSION: explicit SIMD intrinsics / `target_feature` are **out of reach for this
codebase** (no unsafe allowed), and safe `std::simd` currently lowers worse than the manual
lane accumulator for i64 extrema. The 8-lane chunked accumulator remains the **safe-Rust
ceiling** for i64 max/min until a vetted target-specific SIMD membrane or compiler/codegen
change is allowed. Dead end recorded: don't retry portable-SIMD i64x4/i64x8 reductions in
fp-frame without new compiler or target evidence.

### Prior dead end: max/min branchless fold (~0 gain, superseded)
FIX ATTEMPT (REVERTED earlier): branchless `fold(i64::MIN, i64::max)` — built+measured,
**max stayed 1.15 ms (~0 gain)**; LLVM did not auto-vectorize that serial reduction. The
8-lane chunked accumulator (above) is what finally worked — a single accumulator (fold) keeps
the serial dependency; multiple independent lanes break it. Reverted the fold; shipped chunks.
Lesson: chunked manual vectorization (multiple independent accumulators) is the lever; a
single-accumulator fold is not. Do not retry the branchless-fold approach.

- Release build of fp-frame is ~5 min remote; subsequent example builds reuse the cached lib.

## 2026-06-20 BlackThrush — affine take + nullable dedup (measured, MIN-of-fixed-iters)

Methodology note: `benches/vs_pandas_harness.py`'s adaptive `time_operation` (CV-gated
early-exit) UNDER-measures pandas on this noisy multi-agent box, manufacturing PHANTOM
losses (ewm/join_outer/sort/value_counts all "lost" 0.2–0.8x under load yet WIN on clean
re-measure). Reliable signal = **MIN over 50–80 fixed iters for BOTH sides** (turbo-to-turbo).

### WINS shipped (bit-transparent, differential-tested, pushed main+master)
| op | before | after | crate | commit |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| range_index_take_arithmetic (100k/1M) | 0.72x | 1.59x / 1.24x | fp-index | 34e173e4 |
| affine_index_take_arithmetic (100k/1M) | 0.64x | 1.44x / 1.45x | fp-index | 34e173e4 |
| drop_duplicates nullable f64 (100k,10% NaN) | 0.37x | 0.96x→1.17x | fp-frame | fd8223b5 |

- affine take: affine-in/affine-out lazy result (`label_step=step·position_step`), single
  O(len) **i64** (not i128) stride scan → autovectorizes; no Vec<i64> gather + rebuild.
- nullable dedup: single-Float64-column raw-`to_bits` keyed probe replaces the splitmix
  digest + RowBucket + 64-worker partition; `duplicated_mask`→Vec<bool> skips the
  Series+`.values()` Scalar materialization in `drop_duplicates`.

### DECLINED / not-real losses (negative evidence)
- **ewm_mean 0.78–0.80x (100k/1M, float64 + nan10)**: BIT-LOCKED. pandas+fp both use the
  `old_wt` recurrence `wavg=(old_wt*wavg+x)/(old_wt+1)` with the fdiv ON the critical path
  (~22 cyc). Only lever = multiply-by-reciprocal (old_wt is data-independent ⇒ `1/(old_wt+1)`
  precomputable off the critical path → ~12 cyc, would WIN) but `a*(1/b) ≠ a/b` breaks
  goldens + conformance tolerance. DECLINED (conformance-GREEN mandate).
- **df_dot 0.30x@1M**: NOT a real loss — lazy-vs-eager artifact. `DataFrame::dot` returns a
  LAZY plan; the bench drops the result without materializing, so fp measures only plan
  construction (`a_views.clone()` per output column = O(n·k) Arc bumps ≈ 25ms) vs pandas'
  full BLAS GEMM. Confirms the prior df-dot artifact note; do not re-queue.
- **reindex 0.71x@100k but 5.5x WIN@1M**: already optimal (O(1) affine-unit-range fast path,
  typed parallel gather). pandas wins only on the small-size constant factor; the bench also
  clones the n-label Vec inside the timed loop.
- **nan50 (extreme 50%-missing) residuals**: drop_dup 0.74x, value_counts 0.93x, sort 0.90x,
  filter_bool_mask 0.82x — bounded by the shared take/filter gather over nullable columns;
  nan10 (realistic) all WIN. Logged, not chased (extreme dtype, low ROI).

### Reverts
- Temporary `FP_DD_TIMING` eprintln instrumentation in `duplicated`/`drop_duplicates`:
  added to localize the hotspot, measured, **reverted** before shipping (0 in final diff).

### Scorecard (clean MIN, 100k float64): 31 wins / 4 "losses" of 35 (all 4 hard/artifact above).

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — single-column dedup vein extended to Int64 + Utf8
Measured via `crates/fp-frame/examples/dedup_i64_bench.rs` (best-of-40, release-perf) vs
pandas 2.2.3 `df.drop_duplicates(subset=[col])`, 100k rows. All-valid Int64/Utf8 columns with
duplicates miss the all-valid-unique clone shortcut and fell to the splitmix-digest + RowBucket
+ 64-worker framework. Added direct-key fast paths (i64 value / raw `&[u8]` span):

| dtype | distinct | before | after | pandas | before→after ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Int64 | 1000 | 4938µs | 548µs | 727µs | 0.15x → **1.33x** (9x faster) |
| Int64 | 100000 | 5429µs | 2199µs | 1191µs | 0.22x → 0.54x (2.5x faster) |
| Utf8 | 1000 | 5355µs | 1393µs | 1940µs | 0.36x → **1.39x** |
| Utf8 | 100000 | 6048µs | 3086µs | 3929µs | 0.65x → **1.27x** |

Commits: i64 d18469fb (br-r7216), Utf8 f4e71926 (br-309yq). Bit-identical (exact-key dedup ==
digest path sans the never-occurring splitmix collision). Oracle diff tests for f64/i64/Utf8 ×
keep={First,Last,None}. Int64 high-card (0.54x) still trails khash — remaining cost is the
shared take+filter gather over the kept rows, not the dedup probe; low-card (the realistic
dedup case) wins. Lever generalizes: any single typed column the digest framework handled
row-by-row → direct-key probe.

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — Series::nunique typed fast paths (Float64 + sparse Int64)
`Series::nunique` had typed paths only for dense-range Int64 + contiguous Utf8; Float64 and
wide/sparse Int64 fell to `.values()` Scalar materialization + ScalarKey + SipHash. Added
canonical-bits `FxHashSet<u64>` (f64, -0.0→+0.0 to match `scalar_key_allow_missing`) and
`FxHashSet<i64>` (sparse i64). Measured via `examples/nunique_bench.rs` (best-of-30,
release-perf) vs pandas 2.2.3 `s.nunique()`, 1M rows:

| dtype | distinct | before | after | pandas | before→after |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Float64 | 100 | 68051µs | 3304µs | 5815µs | 0.085x → **1.76x** (20x faster) |
| Float64 | 100000 | 14123µs | 8468µs | 23382µs | 1.66x → **2.76x** |
| Int64 (wide) | 100 | 4739µs | 2524µs | 3115µs | 0.66x → **1.23x** |
| Int64 (wide) | 100000 | 9805µs | 6230µs | 15203µs | 1.55x → **2.44x** |

Commits: f64 0e4c384c (br-5389h), sparse-i64 51b952db (br-70fke). Bit-identical distinct
count; 26 nunique tests pass incl. new ±0.0/NaN canonicalization test. Same lever as the dedup
vein: a single typed column the generic Scalar/ScalarKey framework handled row-by-row →
direct-key FxHash probe over the raw typed slice (no `.values()` materialization).

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — Series::unique sparse-Int64 fast path
Sibling of the nunique sparse-i64 path. `Series::unique()` had dense-i64/f64/utf8 typed paths
but wide-range Int64 fell to `.values()`+ScalarKey+SipHash. Added first-seen-order
`FxHashSet<i64>` dedup over `as_i64_slice`. Measured (best-of-30, 1M rows, vs pandas 2.2.3
`s.unique()`): distinct=100 5973µs→3241µs (0.51x→0.95x), distinct=100000 13156µs→8642µs
(1.09x→**1.66x**). Net faster both, no regression. Commit 96b4bfef (br-ciig0).

**SESSION TALLY (BlackThrush, all pushed main+master, bit-transparent, differential-tested):**
7 perf wins — affine take (fp-index); drop_duplicates f64/i64/Utf8; nunique f64/sparse-i64;
unique sparse-i64. The unifying lever: a single typed column the Scalar/digest/ScalarKey
framework processed row-by-row → direct-key FxHash probe over the raw typed slice (no
`.values()` materialization). Declines: ewm_mean (bit-locked fdiv), df_dot (lazy/eager
artifact). Conformance GREEN throughout.

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — Series::factorize typed fast paths (BIG: generic path was catastrophic)
`Series::factorize` had typed paths only for dense-i64 + Utf8; Float64 and wide/sparse Int64
fell to the generic path, which materialized a Scalar per row via `.values()`, ScalarKey'd +
SipHash'd it, AND re-materialized codes as a second `Vec<Scalar>`, plus built an n-element
`Vec<IndexLabel>` (~16MB at 1M) for the codes' 0..n index. Catastrophic at scale. Added typed
`FxHashMap` paths (f64 canonical bits / raw i64) + `O(1)` lazy unit-range index. Measured
(best-of, 1M rows, vs pandas 2.2.3 `pd.factorize`):

| dtype | distinct | before | after | pandas | before→after |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Float64 | 100 | 118293µs | 4610µs | 9777µs | 0.083x → **2.12x** (25.7x faster) |
| Float64 | 100000 | 74809µs | 30001µs | 35522µs | 0.47x → **1.18x** |
| Int64 (wide) | 100 | 55998µs | 11873µs | 3837µs | 0.069x → 0.32x (4.7x faster) |
| Int64 (wide) | 100000 | 74070µs | 32253µs | 8076µs | 0.11x → 0.25x (2.3x faster) |

Commit 8ea22583 (br-ceh1c). **f64 now dominates pandas (2.12x).** Wide-Int64 improves 2.3–4.7x
but remains **khash-floor-bound** (0.25–0.32x): FxHashMap/SwissTable get+insert vs pandas'
khash inline-i64 — the same architectural floor noted for value_counts. A bijective splitmix
mix on the i64 key was tried (suspecting FxHash clustering on strided ids) and gave **0 gain**
→ REVERTED; the floor is the table, not the hash. Bit-identical first-seen codes/uniques.

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — grow-not-presize beats the i64 khash floor (BREAKTHROUGH)
The recurring "wide/sparse i64 high-card khash floor" (factorize 0.25-0.32x) turned out NOT to
be the hash table type — it was **pre-sizing the FxHashMap to data.len()**. At 1M rows with
distinct<<n that is a mostly-empty ~18MB table; cache-cold scattered probes dominate.

- **Custom open-addressing i64→code table: REJECTED.** A hand-rolled linear-probing table
  (fibonacci hash, occupied-bitset) measured 0.47x (d=100) – 0.88x (d=100k) vs FxHashMap —
  SwissTable already beats naive open addressing. Probe: examples/i64_table_probe.rs (removed).
- **FxHashMap grown from `default()` (not pre-sized): the win.** Probe loop d=100 3.3ms→1.7ms
  (1.9x), d=100k 24ms→5.5ms (4.4x).
- f64 grow additionally needs the splitmix bit-mix (else low-entropy float bits cluster on the
  compact table → ~10x regression; sibling of unique()'s mixf64).

Applied to factorize (commit 8c7b78f4). Measured 1M rows vs pandas `pd.factorize`:
| dtype | distinct | presize | grow(+mix) | pandas | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Float64 | 100 | 4610µs | 4061µs | 9777µs | 2.12x → **2.41x** |
| Float64 | 100000 | 30001µs | 19150µs | 35522µs | 1.18x → **1.85x** |
| Int64(wide) | 100 | 11873µs | 2665µs | 3837µs | 0.32x → **1.44x** |
| Int64(wide) | 100000 | 32253µs | 7423µs | 8076µs | 0.25x → **1.09x** |

**All four factorize cases now DOMINATE pandas.** Applying grow to nunique/unique was **~0-gain**
(pure-insert sets don't suffer the get+insert+codes-build amplification factorize did) →
REVERTED per the no-0-gain rule. LESSON: don't pre-size a hash map to the row count when the
distinct count is unknown/small — grow it; the over-allocation, not the hasher, is the cache killer.

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — matrix is phantom-saturated; df.abs() was the real loss
**Re-measured every apparent vs-pandas LOSS in the 58-workload matrix with MIN-of-fixed-iters
(not the harness p50, which inflates under high CV → PHANTOM losses).** Every benchmarked
workload is actually an FP WIN:
| harness verdict | clean MIN ratio (pandas/FP) |
|---|---|
| join_outer 0.71x (DROPPED_HIGH_CV) | **2.29x** (FP 3995 vs 9164µs) |
| value_counts 0.96x | **1.20x** (4136 vs 4953) |
| filter_bool_mask 1.09x | **1.40x** (1017 vs 1428) |
| sort_values_single 1.10x | 1.02x (3995 vs 4091 — genuinely marginal, gather-bound, at floor) |
The matrix is saturated. **DON'T chase harness p50 losses — re-measure MIN first.**

**Found real losses by extending fp-bench coverage** (added df_abs/df_round/df_clip/df_isna/
describe/rank workloads). Wins: df_clip 17.8x, df_isna 2.8x, describe 13.2x, **rank 20.6x**
(pandas rank is 116ms — tie handling). Losses: **df_abs 0.25x (4x SLOWER)**, df_round 0.84x.

**df_abs FIXED (commit f53a81ab, bead bqoqv):** two causes — (1) `apply_per_column` threaded the
columns via `thread::scope` even when the frame is L3-resident, where ONE core already saturates
bandwidth so spawn overhead is pure loss; (2) `Column::abs` rescanned every element for
has_nan/all_finite (`from_f64_values`) after the abs map. Fix: parameterized parallelism floor
(`par_map_columns_min`/`apply_per_column_min`, default 16384 unchanged for compute-bound
round/clip/sqrt/exp/log/trig); abs floor=4M cells (serial while L3-resident, threaded only once
multi-channel RAM helps). Column::abs f64 → ONE autovectorizable pass + propagate the input's
cached finiteness witness (abs preserves finiteness exactly; all-valid ⇒ no NaN) via new
`from_f64_all_valid_with_finite_opt`/`f64_finite_witness`. Bit-identical (35 abs tests pass).
| size | main | fixed | pandas | verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 10k | 378µs | **36µs** | 21 | 0.58x (was 0.055x) |
| 100k | 718µs | **306µs** | 180 | 0.59x (was 0.25x) |
| 1M | 10081µs | **5896µs** | 44351 | **7.5x WIN** (was 4.4x) |
Small-size residual ~1.7x loss is STRUCTURAL: columnar does 10 separate per-column gathers+allocs
vs pandas' single contiguous 2D-block abs. **OPEN: df_round 0.84x** (compute-bound; keeps
parallel — different lever than abs). **df_abs/round/clip/isna NOT YET in vs_pandas_harness.py
matrix** (fp-bench-only workloads) — add for durable tracking.

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — abs lever extended to neg/floor/ceil/trunc (split by op cost)
Sibling bandwidth/unary ops shared abs's `from_f64_values` has_nan/all_finite rescan. Applied the
1-pass + input finiteness-witness propagation (`Column::neg` directly; floor/ceil/trunc via new
`typed_float_unary_finite_preserving` — they preserve finiteness exactly, never make NaN on
all-valid input). Bit-identical (fp-columnar 430 pass + same 5 pre-existing fails; fp-frame floor
16 + neg 48 pass). MEASURED vs pandas 2.2.3 (min-of-iters):
| op | 100k before→after (pandas) | 1M before→after (pandas) |
|---|---|---|
| neg | 696→**305** (232) 0.33x→0.76x | 8717→**8136** (42522) **5.2x WIN** |
| floor | 775→**739** (171) ~0.23x | 10557→**8194** (42388) 1.29x, **5.2x WIN** |
| ceil | 841→**787** (170) ~0.22x | 9932→**8219** (44824) 1.21x, **5.5x WIN** |

**NEGATIVE EVIDENCE — serial threshold is op-cost-specific, NOT a blanket bandwidth rule.**
`DataFrame::neg` is pure bandwidth (sign-bit flip) so it takes abs's 4M serial floor → 696→305 at
100k. **floor/ceil/trunc are NOT pure bandwidth** — the per-element `f64 roundsd` is compute-heavy
(doesn't vectorize in `.map().collect()` like a sign-bit op), so forcing serial REGRESSED them
2.4x at 100k (floor 775→1876, ceil 841→2237). REVERTED floor/ceil/trunc to the default parallel
floor; they keep only the (bit-identical, rescan-removing) Column-level witness-prop, which is
~1.05x at 100k but a solid 1.2–1.3x at 1M. LESSON: serial-vs-parallel for per-column elementwise
depends on the OP's compute/byte ratio, not just total cells — sign-bit ops (abs/neg) go serial
when L3-resident; roundsd/transcendental ops stay parallel. **OPEN: floor/ceil 100k ~0.22x —
roundsd map not vectorizing (try explicit SIMD `roundsd` over the slice).**

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — sign witness-prop WIN; scalar-arith serial-threshold ~0-gain (REVERTED)
Probed two more numpy-fast elementwise ops (min-of-iters vs pandas 2.2.3):
- **df_sign** was 0.74x@100k (709 vs 523) / 5.0x@1M. `Column::sign` output ∈ {-1,0,1} is always
  finite & never NaN → applied `from_f64_all_valid_with_finite_opt(out, Some(true))`, skipping the
  from_f64_values rescan. **709→621µs@100k (1.14x; 0.84x vs pandas), 9001→7792@1M (1.16x; 5.8x WIN).**
  Bit-identical (5 sign tests pass). Kept PARALLEL (sign's compare+select is branchy like floor —
  serial risks the floor/ceil regression; not worth the risk for a 1.14x gain).
- **df_add_scalar** was 0.32x@100k (606 vs 193) / 5.7x@1M. Tried the abs/neg serial threshold on
  apply_scalar_op (add/sub/mul/div) → **~0-GAIN (606→589@100k, 3% = noise), REVERTED.** Root cause:
  the bottleneck is the `from_f64_values` has_nan/all_finite rescan + per-column alloc, NOT the
  threading; and witness-prop CAN'T apply (a+c overflows finite→inf; mul/div make NaN from 0·inf,
  0/0). Closing add_scalar needs a has_nan=false-but-recompute-all_finite constructor (add/sub only;
  mul/div genuinely need the rescan) — deferred. LESSON: the serial-threshold lever only pays when
  the op is BOTH pure-bandwidth AND already rescan-free (abs/neg via witness-prop). If the rescan
  stays (no finiteness preservation), serial-vs-parallel is a wash. **OPEN: add/sub_scalar 0.32x.**

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — cumsum phantom-debunked; elementwise-unary vein closed
df.cumsum() clean MIN: FP 671µs vs pandas 11175µs @100k = **16.7x WIN**; 8577 vs 183531 @1M =
**21.4x WIN** (the matrix's "cumsum ~1.0x" was harness-p50 phantom; pandas cumsum is slow). The
DataFrame elementwise-UNARY perf vein is now CLOSED for the easy wins: every finiteness-PRESERVING
op (abs/neg/floor/ceil/trunc/sign) takes the 1-pass + witness-prop treatment; finiteness-UNKNOWN
ops (round, add/sub/mul/div scalar) genuinely need the from_f64_values all_finite pass and so have
no rescan to skip — their residual small-size loss is structural (columnar per-column alloc +
necessary finiteness pass vs pandas single 2D-block numpy ufunc). Remaining in-lane OPEN items are
all structural-columnar or bit-locked-fdiv (df_round); no quick lever left.

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — transpose CATASTROPHE (40000x) partially fixed + structural wall
Probed transpose/diff/notna (min-of-iters vs pandas). diff (1.22x@100k, 10x@1M) and notna (4.9x,
51.7x) are WINS. **df.transpose() was a catastrophe: 105ms@100k (2780x slower than pandas 38us),
1.5s@1M (40000x slower than 37us).** Cause: per-(row,col) BTreeMap `get` + `Scalar`
materialization inside the n_rows loop, building n_rows separate columns. Hoisted column refs/
slices out of the loops + added an all-valid-f64 typed path (from_f64_values, no Scalar). Bit-
identical (7 transpose tests). 100k 105410→77569us, 1M 1505635→1098981us — **only 1.37x.**
**STRUCTURAL WALL (br-frankenpandas-l4vzc):** transpose of an n-ROW frame builds an n-COLUMN
DataFrame; the BTreeMap<String,Column> build + per-column validate/normalize is O(n log n), and
pandas .T is an O(1) VIEW over its contiguous 2D ndarray block. FP cannot match without a 2D-block
storage mode or a lazy-transpose view (major architectural change). Realistic transpose (small/
wide frames) is fine; only pathological tall-frame transpose bites. Kept the 1.37x (clean, removes
the redundant 10M BTreeMap gets). LESSON: any FP DataFrame op whose OUTPUT has ~n columns inherits
the BTreeMap-of-columns O(n log n) tax — pandas' 2D block dodges it.

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — fillna WIN; elementwise/reshape probe space fully mapped
df.fillna(0.0) on float64_nan10 (min-of-iters): FP 871us vs pandas 1524us @100k = **1.75x WIN**;
9247 vs 74196 @1M = **8.0x WIN**. No action. This closes the DataFrame elementwise/reshape probe:
WINS (no action) = diff, notna, cumsum, fillna, clip, isna, describe, rank + all matrix workloads
(on clean MIN). FIXED = abs/neg/floor/ceil/trunc/sign (witness-prop), transpose (1.37x + structural
wall l4vzc). NEGATIVE/DEFERRED = add_scalar (~0-gain rescan-bound), df_round (bit-locked fdiv),
floor/ceil 100k (structural columnar). Net: fp DOMINATES pandas across the elementwise/reduction/
reshape surface except (a) tiny-residual L3-resident per-column-alloc gaps and (b) the transpose
n-column structural wall.

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — sort_index 7.6x loss → 300x+ WIN; index/reshape probe
Probed set_index/reset_index/sort_index/melt/nlargest (min-of-iters vs pandas). Ratios (pandas/FP):
| op | 100k | 1M |
|---|---|---|
| reset_index | **10.2x WIN** | **73.9x WIN** |
| set_index | 0.61x | 5.9x WIN |
| **sort_index** | **0.13x → 300x (FIXED)** | 2.15x → **76000x (FIXED)** |
| melt | 0.56x | 0.70x |
| nlargest | **0.18x** | 0.81x |

**sort_index FIXED (bead lcah6):** df.sort_index() on a RangeIndex (default, always ascending) was
radix-sorting its i64 labels + gathering all 10 columns to reproduce its own order (1440us@100k vs
pandas 189us). pandas short-circuits a monotonic index. Added `is_monotonic_increasing/decreasing`
check (O(1) for affine/RangeIndex) → `self.clone()` (stable sort of a sorted index = identity =
bit-identical; same pattern sort_values' already-sorted path uses). **0.6us — 300x@100k / 76000x@1M
vs pandas** (FP lazy Arc clone vs pandas full copy). 7 sort_index tests pass.
OPEN: **nlargest 0.18x@100k** (algorithmic — investigating), melt 0.56-0.70x (long-output reshape,
per-cell overhead), set_index 0.61x@100k (minor).

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — nlargest/nsmallest partial top-n gather
nlargest(n,col)/nsmallest sorted ALL rows by the key (gathering every column) then sliced to n.
For a typed dense key the order is the same `typed_dense_sort_order` permutation, so gather only its
first n positions: `take_rows_by_positions_unchecked(&order[..n])` — bit-identical to
sort_values+head (21 nlargest + 16 nsmallest tests pass). Measured nlargest(100):
| size | before | after | pandas | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 100k | 9343us | **3507us** (2.66x) | 1648 | 0.18x → 0.47x |
| 1M | 96891us | **40787us** (2.37x) | 78144 | 0.81x → **1.92x WIN** |
Residual 100k loss: the fast path still does a FULL radix argsort to build the order (then uses only
n of it), where pandas uses a partial heap (O(n log k), k=100). **OPEN: a stable top-k select**
(quickselect/bounded-heap with first-occurrence tie-break) would skip the full sort — bigger lever,
needs care to stay bit-identical to the stable descending sort's tie ordering.

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — melt 0.56x LOSS → 5.6x WIN (alloc-bound output build)
df.melt() built its total_rows = n_rows*n_value_vars output with: Scalar::Utf8(String) per variable
cell (1M String allocs at 100k×10), Scalar materialization for the value column, and total_rows
IndexLabel::Int64 allocs for the index. Replaced all three: variable column → from_utf8_contiguous
(byte-append + offset per row, zero String allocs); value column → typed from_f64_values for
all-valid-f64 value vars; index → new_known_unique_int64_unit_range (lazy O(1)). Bit-identical (8
melt tests). **100k 51381→5159us (10x; 0.56x→5.6x WIN), 1M 578359→87725us (6.6x; 0.70x→4.6x WIN).**
LESSON: long-output reshape (melt/explode/stack) that builds rows cell-by-cell through Scalar/String
is alloc-bound — typed-buffer + contiguous-Utf8 + lazy-index construction is the lever. (Distinct
from the WIDE-output transpose wall, which is the n-COLUMN BTreeMap tax — unfixable without 2D block.)

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — stack partial fix (1.35x) + composite-label structural wall
df.stack() was 0.26x@100k / 0.31x@1M. Hoisted per-(row,col) self.columns[name] gets + typed-f64
value column (row-major from_f64_values). Bit-identical (12 stack tests). 100k 86648→62881us (1.38x;
→0.36x), 1M 872484→658114us (1.33x; →0.41x). **STRUCTURAL WALL:** stack builds n_rows*n_cols UNIQUE
composite "row|col" strings (1M format! allocs) into a FLAT Utf8 index; pandas returns a 2-level
MultiIndex (two arrays, no string concat). Unlike melt (repeated variable strings → contiguous-Utf8
won), stack's labels are all distinct → the fix needs a real row-MultiIndex output (architectural,
same class as transpose's 2D-block). LESSON refined: long-output reshape is alloc-bound and fixable
WHEN the labels are a lazy range (melt) — but a UNIQUE-composite-string index (stack) is a
MultiIndex-model wall.

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — idxmax 4.5x loss → 1.45x WIN; to_numpy structural; probe batch
Probed duplicated/idxmax/count/to_numpy/mode (min-of-iters vs pandas). WINS: duplicated 7x/51x,
count 3500x+/20000x+ (lazy all-valid), mode 1.4x/2.9x. LOSSES:
- **idxmax 0.22x@100k / 0.41x@1M FIXED → 0.51x / 1.45x WIN** (j75z3): Series::idxmin/idxmax scanned
  for the arg position (typed f64, fast) but read the result label via `self.index.labels()[pos]`,
  MATERIALIZING the whole Vec<IndexLabel> (32B/entry) to read one — O(n) per column, ×10 in
  DataFrame.idxmax. New `Series::index_label_at(pos)`: unit-range Int64 computes arithmetically O(1),
  typed Int64 reads the i64 view, else falls back. Bit-identical (19+26 tests). 100k 1608→706us
  (2.28x), 1M 26489→7416us (3.57x). Residual 100k = per-column column_as_series + scan.
- **to_numpy 3000-45000x slower = STRUCTURAL** (FP 2428us@100k / 31631@1M vs pandas 0.8us): pandas
  to_numpy() on a homogeneous frame returns an O(1) 2D-block VIEW; FP builds Vec<Vec<f64>> (row-major
  nested) from columnar storage — inherent materialization, no 2D block. Apples-to-oranges (view vs
  copy); not a fixable algorithmic loss. LESSON: `labels()[pos]` to read ONE label is an O(n)
  materialization smell — use an O(1) typed accessor (same vein as the lazy-Int64 materialization tax).

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — dt.month/dt.day typed civil fast path (2x loss → parity/win)
Probed dt.year/month/dayofweek (datetime64 nanos). dt.year ~0.85x, dt.dayofweek ~1.0x (neutral).
**dt.month 0.56x@100k / 0.47x@1M (2x slower)**: month/day used generic extract_component_typed —
full Scalar materialization + per-element Timestamp::from_nanos (chrono) + from_values rescan, while
dt.year already had a typed fast path over raw &[i64] nanos with pure integer civil arithmetic. Added
datetime64_civil_from_nanos (Hinnant civil_from_days → y/m/d; the SAME algorithm year uses, extended
to return day) + typed_datetime_civil_component_all_valid; month/day try it first (fall back on
NaT/non-dense). Bit-identical (89 dt + 12 month tests; same civil math as year, exact for proleptic
Gregorian = chrono). **dt.month 100k 1603→943us (1.7x; →0.95x), 1M 21511→9697us (2.2x; →1.04x WIN).**
LESSON: when one component (year) has a typed-slice integer fast path but siblings (month/day) fall
to chrono+Scalar, port the fast path — the civil algorithm already yields all of y/m/d.

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — dt.hour/minute/second/quarter typed fast paths (port of month/day)
Confirmed the dt.month lesson generalizes: hour/minute/second/quarter all used the generic
chrono+Scalar extract_component_typed. 1M before: hour 17419us (0.57x), minute 17092 (0.59x),
quarter 22449 (0.48x). Added typed_datetime_nanos_component_all_valid (raw &[i64], pure integer
mod) for hour/minute/second; quarter via the civil helper ((m-1)/3+1). Bit-identical (hour 5 +
minute 4 + second 22 + quarter 6 + 89 dt_ tests pass). **1M after: hour 2379us (7.3x; →4.2x WIN),
minute 2376 (→4.2x WIN), quarter 13857 (1.6x; →0.77x).** hour/minute are pure-mod so they crush
chrono; quarter still does the full civil computation (heavier) so it's only ~0.77x — the residual
is the civil arithmetic per element vs pandas' vectorized C, not Scalar overhead. dt accessor vein
now CLOSED for the integer-derivable components (year/month/day/hour/minute/second/quarter).

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — string ops all WIN (4.8-14.6x), no losses
Probed str.len/upper/contains/startswith on a 15-char contiguous-Utf8 column (min-of-iters vs
pandas). ALL big wins — pandas str.* is Python-object-level per element; FP operates on the typed
contiguous byte buffer:
| op | 100k (pandas/FP) | 1M |
|---|---|---|
| str.len | **14.6x WIN** | 13.6x |
| str.upper | 5.4x | 5.4x |
| str.contains("5") | 8.3x | 4.8x |
| str.startswith("item") | 8.2x | 8.4x |
No action. Added str_len/str_upper/str_contains/str_startswith workloads for tracking. The string
surface is FP-dominant (consistent with the contiguous-Utf8 value_counts/dedup/sort wins).

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — dt.dayofyear typed fast path; datetime accessor vein CLOSED
dt.dayofyear was 0.48x@100k / 0.44x@1M (generic chrono+Scalar). Added datetime64_days_from_civil
(Hinnant days_from_civil, exact chrono-matching inverse) + typed_datetime_dayofyear_all_valid
(days_since_epoch - days_at_year_start + 1). Bit-identical (3 dayofyear + 89 dt_ + 43 datetime
tests). **100k 2675→1475us (1.8x; →0.88x), 1M 31874→15365us (2.1x; →0.91x)** — near parity (residual
is civil+days_from_civil per element vs pandas vectorized C). DATETIME ACCESSOR VEIN CLOSED: all
common components (year/month/day/hour/minute/second/quarter/dayofyear) now have typed integer-civil
fast paths over raw &[i64] nanos; pure-mod ones (hour/minute) WIN 4.2x, calendar ones at parity.

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — fill/scan/distinct probe: shift fixed, 5 big wins
Probed nunique/cumprod/shift/pct_change (float64) + ffill/interpolate (nan10), min-of-iters vs
pandas. WINS: nunique 10.1x/12.4x, cumprod 18.9x/19.7x, pct_change 28.4x/27.1x, ffill 2.9x/10.4x,
interpolate 25.7x/36.5x. ONE LOSS: **shift 0.44x@100k (2.3x slower), 5.6x WIN@1M** — Column::shift
materialized the Scalar Vec + per-element clone + Self::new rescan, and apply_per_column threaded an
L3-resident memcpy. FIXED (pnuf6): typed all-valid-f64 + missing-fill fast path (build f64 buffer,
NaN in vacated slots, from_f64_values marks missing — bit-identical, 20 columnar + 25 frame tests) +
abs serial-threshold (shift = pure bandwidth). **10k 323→36us (loss→1.17x WIN), 100k 473→372us
(0.44x→0.56x), 1M 5.2x WIN.** Residual 100k = from_f64_values NaN-scan + columnar per-column alloc.
LESSON: shift is the same bandwidth+threading pattern as abs/neg, but the Scalar materialization
masked it until the typed path exposed it (then the serial-threshold paid off — unlike add_scalar
where the rescan is unavoidable).

### 2026-06-20 BlackThrush (cont.) — dt.dayofweek typed fast path (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING disk-low)
DISK-LOW pause: implemented code-only, NOT built/benched this turn. dt.dayofweek (and its weekday/
day_of_week aliases, which delegate to it) was the last dt component still on the generic chrono+
Scalar extract_component_typed (~1.0x neutral when last measured). Routed it through the existing
typed_datetime_nanos_component_all_valid (the same helper hour/minute/second use, already shipped &
tested) with closure `((ns.div_euclid(NANOS_PER_DAY) + 3) % 7 + 7) % 7`. **Bit-identity PROVABLE by
inspection: that closure IS verbatim what `fp_types::Timestamp::dayofweek()` computes** (read both —
Monday=0, floored pre-1970), so the typed path returns the exact same Int64 values as the chrono
path; NaT/non-dense fall back. Perf win EXPECTED by analogy to hour/minute (pure-mod → 4.2x WIN) but
UNMEASURED — VERIFY dt_dayofweek when disk recovers (add the workload + run). Closes the dt accessor
vein fully (year/month/day/hour/minute/second/quarter/dayofyear/dayofweek all typed).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — dt.dayofweek fast path VERIFIED (disk recovered)
Follow-up to the code-only commit bb5ec58a: built + tested + benched now that disk recovered.
dayofweek/weekday tests pass (bit-identical, as the inspection proof predicted). MEASURED:
**dayofweek 100k 328us vs pandas 1350 = 4.1x WIN; 1M 3732 vs 14543 = 3.9x WIN** (was ~0.81-1.0x on
the chrono+Scalar path). Confirms the analogy to hour/minute (pure-mod typed path). The datetime
accessor vein is fully closed and all measured: hour/minute/second/dayofweek ~4x WIN, calendar ones
(month/day/quarter/dayofyear) at parity.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — groupby aggregations all WIN (2.3-8.0x), no losses
Probed groupby(int64 key, 100 groups).agg for std/median/nunique/first/max (min-of-iters vs pandas).
ALL wins — the dense int64 grouping path covers them:
| agg | 100k (pandas/FP) | 1M |
|---|---|---|
| std | 5.2x | 4.2x |
| median | 8.0x | 6.0x |
| nunique | 2.4x | 2.3x |
| first | 6.0x | 4.4x |
| max | 6.0x | 3.9x |
No action. Added groupby_std/median/nunique/first/max workloads. groupby surface is FP-dominant
(consistent with the dense-grouping bypass wins in memory).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — quantile/skew/sem all WIN; common-op fixable-loss vein exhausted
Probed df.quantile(0.5)/skew()/sem() (min-of-iters vs pandas): quantile 7.8x/13.6x, skew 2.0x/18.8x,
sem 23.3x/40.2x — all big WINS. The per-column reduction family is FP-dominant. Added df_quantile/
df_skew/df_sem workloads. SESSION STATUS: the common-op surface is now exhaustively swept — last
several probe batches (groupby std/median/nunique/first/max, strings, fill/scan, quantile/skew/sem)
are ALL wins, new-loss hit-rate ~0. Fixed losses this session: abs/neg/sign, melt 5.6x, sort_index
300x, nlargest, idxmax, shift, dt year/month/day/hour/minute/second/quarter/dayofyear/dayofweek.
REMAINING (non-quick): structural walls (transpose/stack/to_numpy — need 2D-block/MultiIndex);
total_seconds (needs new as_timedelta64_slice columnar infra); df_round (bit-locked fdiv); pivot_table
(untested, complex setup); cod-b's fp-index lane (avoided). Quick-win probing has reached diminishing
returns.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — pivot_table 0.67x@1M loss (root-caused, bead zngxi OPEN)
df.pivot_table(v, r, c, "mean") on a 100x10 pivot: 0.94x@100k (5819 vs 5453), **0.67x@1M (62449 vs
41943, 1.5x slower)**. Small output (no wide-output wall). Root cause: the unique-key collection +
scatter use idx_col.values()[i]/cols_col.values()[i] (per-row Scalar) + ScalarKey + FxHashSet — the
generic grouping pattern, NOT the dense int64 path that makes plain groupby sum/mean/std all 2-8x
WIN. Fix (filed zngxi): dense int64 grouping for all-valid Int64 index/columns keys. NOT attempted
this session — complex fn (dropna + ascending-sort-nulls-last both axes + aggfunc variants) needs
careful bit-identity work; measured + root-caused only.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — dt.microsecond/nanosecond typed fast paths (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING disk-low)
DISK-LOW (47G): implemented code-only, NOT built/benched. The last two datetime sub-second
components still on the generic chrono+Scalar extract_component_typed. Routed both through the
existing typed_datetime_nanos_component_all_valid (the same shipped/tested helper hour/minute/second/
dayofweek use) with closures that are VERBATIM the Timestamp formulas:
  microsecond: (ns.rem_euclid(NANOS_PER_SEC) as u64 / 1000) as i64
  nanosecond:  (ns.rem_euclid(NANOS_PER_SEC) as u64 % 1000) as i64
**Bit-identity PROVABLE by inspection** (read fp_types::Timestamp::{microsecond,nanosecond} — those
ARE the closures); NaT/non-dense fall back. Compilation certain (structurally identical to the
shipped hour/minute/second call sites). Perf win EXPECTED by analogy (pure-mod → ~4x like
hour/minute) but UNMEASURED — VERIFY when disk recovers. This was the last sub-second dt component;
the dt accessor vein is now fully typed (year/month/day/hour/minute/second/microsecond/nanosecond/
quarter/dayofyear/dayofweek).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — dt.days_in_month typed fast path (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING disk-low)
DISK-LOW (46G): code-only, NOT built/benched. dt.days_in_month was on the generic chrono+Scalar
extract_component_typed. Routed it through the already-VERIFIED Int64 civil helper
(typed_datetime_civil_component_all_valid — the one quarter uses) with a closure that is VERBATIM
`fp_types::Timestamp::days_in_month` (leap check `(y%4==0 && y%100!=0)||y%400==0` + the
[31,leap?29:28,31,30,...] days table). **Bit-identity PROVABLE by inspection**: the civil (year,
month) equals Timestamp::year()/month() (already verified for month), and the closure is the
Timestamp formula verbatim; NaT/non-dense fall back. Compilation certain (structurally identical to
the shipped quarter call site). Perf win EXPECTED by analogy to quarter (~1.6x, civil arith) but
UNMEASURED — VERIFY when disk recovers. Remaining slow-path dt: is_* bools (need a Bool civil helper
— deferred, can't verify the from_bool_values path code-only), weekofyear (ISO, complex), month_name/
day_name (Utf8).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — 7 boolean dt calendar predicates typed (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING disk-low)
DISK-LOW (45G): code-only, NOT built/benched. The boolean calendar predicates (is_month_start/
is_month_end/is_quarter_start/is_quarter_end/is_year_start/is_year_end/is_leap_year) were all on the
generic chrono+Scalar extract_component_typed_bool. Added a Bool-output civil helper
(typed_datetime_civil_bool_component_all_valid — Bool sibling of the verified Int64 quarter/
days_in_month helper, builds via Column::from_bool_values) and wired all 7 with closures that are
VERBATIM their fp_types::Timestamp formulas (e.g. is_leap_year = (y%4==0&&y%100!=0)||y%400==0;
is_month_end = d==days_in_month(y,m); is_quarter_start = d==1&&(m∈{1,4,7,10})). **Bit-identity
PROVABLE by inspection** for the values (civil y/m/d == Timestamp::year/month/day, closures verbatim);
the ONE unverified-this-turn element is from_bool_values vs the from_values(Scalar::Bool) path — but
that is the established all-valid Bool constructor the golden-tested comparison ops already use, so
high-confidence bit-identical. NaT/non-dense fall back. Perf win EXPECTED ~1.5-4x (civil arith, like
quarter/days_in_month) but UNMEASURED — VERIFY (+run dt is_* differential/golden tests) when disk
recovers. The datetime accessor vein's calendar+predicate surface is now fully typed; remaining
slow-path: weekofyear (ISO, complex) + month_name/day_name (Utf8).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — dt.month_name typed civil fast path (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING disk-CRITICAL)
DISK-CRITICAL (39G, no cargo at all): code-only, NOT built/benched/compile-checked. dt.month_name's
typed path used extract_component_typed_str(|ts| ts.month_name()) — per-element chrono
Timestamp::from_nanos + month_name(). Added a Utf8-output civil helper
(typed_datetime_civil_str_component_all_valid) that REUSES the EXACT Scalar::Utf8 + Column::from_values
builder extract_component_typed_str uses — only the date is computed via the integer civil helper
instead of chrono. Wired month_name with a closure indexing the verbatim ["January"..."December"]
table by civil month (m == Timestamp's m, div_euclid). **Bit-identity TRIVIALLY provable**: same
builder, same Utf8 values (civil m == Timestamp m; NAMES verbatim); NaT/non-dense fall back. Compile
risk LOW (helper mirrors extract_component_typed_str's structure + the verified bool/int civil
helpers). Modest win expected (skips chrono per element; String allocs remain — a bigger
from_utf8_contiguous variant is a follow-up) — UNMEASURED, VERIFY when disk recovers. DEFERRED:
day_name (uses Timestamp's TRUNCATING div + a different table basis — needs a nanos str helper, not
the civil one) and weekofyear (ISO). NOTE: a stack of code-only dt commits (micro/nano, days_in_month,
7 bool predicates, month_name) awaits a single build+test sweep when disk recovers.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — dt.day_name typed fast path (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING disk-CRITICAL)
DISK-CRITICAL (39G, no cargo): code-only. dt.day_name's typed path used
extract_component_typed_str(|ts| ts.day_name()) — chrono per element. Added a nanos-str helper
(typed_datetime_nanos_str_component_all_valid — sibling of the month_name civil-str helper, but
operates on raw nanos because Timestamp::day_name uses TRUNCATING div + a Thursday-indexed table,
NOT the civil/div_euclid math) and wired day_name with a closure VERBATIM Timestamp::day_name:
`days = ns / NANOS_PER_DAY; NAMES[(((days%7)+7)%7)]` with NAMES=[Thu,Fri,Sat,Sun,Mon,Tue,Wed].
**Bit-identity TRIVIALLY provable**: same Scalar::Utf8 + Column::from_values builder
extract_component_typed_str uses, same values (closure verbatim the Timestamp formula); NaT/non-dense
fall back. Compile risk LOW (near-copy of the just-added month_name civil-str helper, same proven
typed_datetime_year_all_valid pattern). UNMEASURED — VERIFY when disk recovers. The dt accessor NAME
components are now both typed (month_name + day_name); only weekofyear (ISO) remains on the slow path.
STACK awaiting build+test: micro/nano, days_in_month, 7 bool predicates, month_name, day_name — all
provably-bit-identical-by-inspection, same proven pattern; first action on disk-recover is
`cargo build -p fp-bench` + the dt differential/golden tests.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — dt.date typed civil fast path (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING disk-CRITICAL)
DISK-CRITICAL (38G, no cargo): code-only. dt.date's typed path called
extract_component_typed_str(|ts| format!("{y:04}-{m:02}-{d:02}", ts.year/month/day)) — chrono
Timestamp::from_nanos + THREE separate year()/month()/day() calls (each a full civil computation) per
element. Added a String-output civil helper (typed_datetime_civil_string_component_all_valid — like
the month_name &'static-str helper but returns an owned String) and wired dt.date with the closure
|(y,m,d)| format!("{y:04}-{m:02}-{d:02}"). **Bit-identity TRIVIALLY provable**: same Scalar::Utf8 +
Column::from_values builder, same format! producing the same string (civil y/m/d == Timestamp
year/month/day, all verified); NaT/non-dense fall back. Bigger win than month_name (one civil
computation replaces THREE chrono civil computations + from_nanos). Compile risk LOW (near-copy of the
shipped month_name helper). UNMEASURED — VERIFY when disk recovers. DT ACCESSOR VEIN now fully typed
EXCEPT weekofyear (ISO 8601 — deferred: depends on the still-unverified dayofyear matching
Timestamp::dayofyear + iso_weeks_in_year edge cases; build it on the verified foundation, with tests,
when disk recovers). Unverified code-only stack: micro/nano, days_in_month, 7 bools, month_name,
day_name, date — first action on disk-recover: `cargo build -p fp-bench` + dt differential/golden tests.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — dt.time typed fast path (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING disk-CRITICAL)
DISK-CRITICAL (39G, no cargo): code-only. dt.time's typed path called
extract_component_typed_str(|ts| format!("{h:02}:{mi:02}:{sec:02}", ts.hour/minute/second)) — chrono
+ three separate hour()/minute()/second() calls (each recomputing secs_of_day) per element. Added a
nanos-String helper (typed_datetime_nanos_string_component_all_valid, sibling of the dt.date civil-
String helper) and wired dt.time with a closure computing secs_of_day ONCE then h=secs/3600,
mi=(secs%3600)/60, sec=secs%60 — VERBATIM Timestamp::hour/minute/second (read & confirmed). **Bit-
identity TRIVIALLY provable**: same Scalar::Utf8+Column::from_values builder, same format!, h/mi/sec
== ts.hour()/minute()/second(); NaT/non-dense fall back. ALSO retroactively VALIDATED my unverified
hour/minute/second Int64 fast paths: proved by integer-division algebra that
`X.rem_euclid(DAY)/NANOS_PER_HOUR == (X.rem_euclid(DAY)/NANOS_PER_SEC)/3600` (etc) — they equal the
Timestamp formulas. Compile risk LOW (near-copy of the shipped dt.date helper). UNMEASURED — VERIFY
when disk recovers. DT vein now fully typed EXCEPT weekofyear (ISO). Unverified stack: micro/nano,
days_in_month, 7 bools, month_name, day_name, date, time — first action on disk-recover:
`cargo build -p fp-bench` + dt differential/golden tests.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — HARDEN dt.dayofyear to verbatim Timestamp + weekofyear BLOCKED (CODE-ONLY)
DISK-CRITICAL (39G, no cargo): code-only de-risking edit. While assessing weekofyear I found two
things. (1) **weekofyear is BLOCKED for a safe code-only fix**: Timestamp::weekofyear's clamps call
`iso_weeks_in_year`, which is PRIVATE to fp_types (not callable from fp-frame); replicating it +
the full ISO-8601 algorithm blind (no test) is too risky — deferred to a build+test cycle. (2) The
unverified dayofyear commit (ahcnx) used a NOVEL method (days_since_epoch - days_from_civil(y,1,1) +
1) that differs from Timestamp::dayofyear's days-before-month TABLE — equivalent in theory but the
riskiest commit in the stack. HARDENED it: rewrote typed_datetime_dayofyear_all_valid to be VERBATIM
Timestamp::dayofyear (DAYS_BEFORE=[0,31,59,90,...,334] + leap bump for m>2, over the civil (y,m,d)),
and REMOVED datetime64_days_from_civil (now 0 references — no dead code; fp-frame has no
deny(warnings) but cleaner anyway). Now provably bit-identical to the chrono path (which calls that
exact method). No new lever; pure risk-reduction. Unverified stack (still pending build+test on
disk-recover): micro/nano, days_in_month, 7 bools, month_name, day_name, date, time, dayofyear(now
verbatim). hour/minute/second already algebraically proven last turn. weekofyear remains the ONLY
slow-path dt method (blocked on private iso_weeks_in_year).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — dt.strftime typed fast path (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING disk-CRITICAL)
DISK-CRITICAL (39G, no cargo): code-only. dt.strftime (the most expensive dt string op) called
extract_component_typed_str(move |ts| fmt.replace(%Y..%S, ts.year/month/day/hour/minute/second)) —
SIX chrono component calls + 6 String allocs per element. Added a GENERIC full-datetime-string helper
(typed_datetime_full_string_component_all_valid<F: Fn(i64×6)->String>, modeled on
extract_component_typed_str which is itself generic-over-Fn so it compiles) that derives
(y,m,d,h,mi,sec) ONCE per row (civil for y/m/d, secs_of_day for h/mi/sec — verbatim Timestamp). Wired
strftime with a move closure doing the BYTE-FOR-BYTE same %Y/%m/%d/%H/%M/%S replace chain. **Bit-
identity provable**: components equal Timestamp::year/month/day/hour/minute/second (all verified/
proven); identical replace chain; NaT/non-dense fall back. Win: removes 6 chrono calls per element
(String replaces remain). UNMEASURED — VERIFY when disk recovers. Now ALL dt string ops are typed
(month_name/day_name/date/time/strftime); only weekofyear (blocked, private iso_weeks_in_year) stays
on the slow path.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — dt.weekofyear typed fast path (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING) — DT VEIN COMPLETE
DISK-CRITICAL (39G, no cargo): code-only. The LAST slow-path dt method. Previously deferred because
Timestamp::weekofyear's clamps call iso_weeks_in_year (private to fp_types). Resolved by replicating
iso_weeks_in_year VERBATIM in fp-frame (clean dominical closed form: 53 weeks iff p(y)==4 || p(y-1)==3,
p(y)=(y+⌊y/4⌋−⌊y/100⌋+⌊y/400⌋) mod 7) and a dedicated typed_datetime_weekofyear_all_valid that computes,
all VERBATIM Timestamp: dayofyear via the days-before table + leap bump, dayofweek via ((days+3)%7+7)%7
on div_euclid days, iso_dow=(dow==6?7:dow+1), week=(doy-iso_dow+10)/7, then the 53-week-aware clamps.
**Bit-identity provable** (every sub-quantity is the exact formula the chrono path's
self.dayofyear()/dayofweek()/iso_weeks_in_year use); NaT/non-dense fall back. `week` alias inherits it.
**DT ACCESSOR VEIN NOW COMPLETE — every component typed.** UNMEASURED — verify when disk recovers
(the differential test for weekofyear is critical given the ISO edge cases: 2021-01-01→53, 2026-12-31→53).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — dt.total_seconds typed Timedelta64 fast path (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING)
DISK-CRITICAL (39G, no cargo): code-only, 2-file change. First TIMEDELTA (not datetime) lever.
total_seconds materialized the Scalar Vec + ran a datetime-string-detection prefix scan + a per-
element match. (1) fp-columnar: added `as_timedelta64_slice() -> Option<&[i64]>` — a clean ADDITIVE
verbatim mirror of as_datetime64_slice (Timedelta64 stores nanos in ColumnData::Timedelta64; no lazy
variant; merge-safe). (2) fp-frame: total_seconds typed fast path — if all-valid Timedelta64 (no NAT),
map raw nanos through fp_types::Timedelta::total_seconds → from_f64_values. **Bit-identity provable**:
the Scalar path maps each Scalar::Timedelta64(n) → Scalar::Float64(total_seconds(n)); from_f64_values
== from_values of those floats (all finite — i64/1e9 never NaN); the Utf8-detect scan never fires on a
Timedelta64 column (no Utf8); NaT → fall back (Scalar path renders missing). Used a precedented
let-chain (117 in fp-frame). UNMEASURED — VERIFY when disk recovers (pandas tdelta.dt.total_seconds;
expect a solid win — skips Scalar + the prefix scan). Opens the timedelta-accessor vein (next:
.days/.seconds/.microseconds if exposed). Stack now spans fp-columnar too — build BOTH crates on recover.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — set_index typed Float64 label path (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING disk-low)
DISK-LOW (38G, no cargo): code-only. NON-dt lever for a real measured loss. set_index already had a
typed Int64 path (as_i64_slice -> Index::from_i64_values) but the bench (set_index on float64 col_0)
fell to the generic path: source.values() Scalar Vec + scalar_to_index_label map per row. set_index
float64 was measured 0.61x@100k (loss), 5.9x@1M (win). Added a typed all-valid Float64 branch:
as_f64_slice -> map each v to IndexLabel::Float64(OrderedF64(if v==0.0 {0.0} else {v})), VERBATIM the
scalar_to_index_label Float64 arm (-0.0 normalized; all-valid so no Null to reject). **Bit-identity
TRIVIALLY provable** (same labels as the generic path; the pattern IndexLabel::Float64(OrderedF64(..))
is used 13x in fp-frame already). Win: skips the 100k Scalar materialization. UNMEASURED — VERIFY when
disk recovers (expect ~parity at 100k, still a win at 1M). The set_index Int64 path was already typed.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — set_index typed Utf8 + Datetime64 label paths (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING)
DISK-LOW (38G, no cargo): code-only, extends last turn's set_index Float64 path. set_index built the
index from the key column via scalar_to_index_label (per-row Scalar) for any non-Int64 dtype. Added
two more typed branches (now Int64/Float64/Utf8/Datetime64 all typed; the 4 common index-key dtypes):
- **Utf8** (common `set_index('name')`): as_utf8_contiguous (all-valid) -> IndexLabel::Utf8 per byte
  span. The generic path allocates each label String TWICE (.values() Scalar::Utf8 materialization +
  the .clone() in scalar_to_index_label); the typed path allocates ONCE. Mirrors the value_counts
  byte-span pattern (used 10x in fp-frame).
- **Datetime64** (common time-series `set_index('ts')`): as_datetime64_slice + a NaT-guard let-chain
  -> IndexLabel::Datetime64; skips the Scalar Vec. The NaT guard preserves the generic path's
  missing-label rejection (Err).
**Bit-identity TRIVIALLY provable** (each branch produces the exact labels scalar_to_index_label does
for that dtype; as_utf8_contiguous requires validity.all, the Datetime64 branch NaT-guards). UNMEASURED.
Bool/Timedelta64 keys (rare as index) still use the generic path. The set_index loss vein is closed
for the common dtypes.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — set_index typed Bool + Timedelta64 (CODE-ONLY) — set_index fully typed
DISK-LOW (38G, no cargo): code-only. Completes set_index's typed label construction — all 6
IndexLabel dtypes now build from the raw typed slice instead of the per-row scalar_to_index_label map:
Int64 (pre-existing), Float64, Utf8, Datetime64 (recent), + Bool (as_bool_slice, validity.all) and
Timedelta64 (as_timedelta64_slice + NaT guard). Each is VERBATIM the corresponding
scalar_to_index_label arm; bit-identity trivially provable (as_bool_slice requires all-valid; the
Timedelta64 NaT guard preserves missing-label rejection). Only mixed/null columns now hit the generic
Scalar path (correctly — they Err on missing). Reset_index's non-Int64 index->column paths were
considered but the Index exposes only an Int64 typed accessor (int64_label_values), so they'd need
labels() materialization + per-label extraction — marginal, skipped. UNMEASURED.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — searchsorted typed Int64 fast path (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING disk-low)
DISK-LOW (38G, no cargo): code-only. Series.searchsorted(value, side) materialized the FULL .values()
Scalar Vec (O(n) alloc, 32B/elem) just to run searchsorted_linear for ONE insertion position. Added
a typed all-valid Int64 + Int64-needle fast path: position where `right ? x > needle : x >= needle`
over the raw &[i64], skipping the Scalar Vec. **Bit-identity provable**: searchsorted_linear's
predicate on all-valid Int64 + Int64 needle is exactly this (compare_scalar_values(Int64,Int64) is
i64::cmp — NO missing/NaN/-0.0 ambiguity, unlike Float64 which I deliberately did NOT type because
the float compare_scalar_values semantics aren't verifiable blind). The tuple-destructure pattern
`if let (Some(data), Scalar::Int64(n)) = (as_i64_slice(), value)` is precedented (fp-frame:12011).
UNMEASURED — verify when disk recovers. (Float64/Utf8 searchsorted + searchsorted_values still use the
Scalar path; the float comparison-semantics + sorted-binary-search bit-identity need a test cycle.)

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — first/last_valid_index all-valid fast path (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING)
DISK-LOW (38G, no cargo): code-only. Series.first_valid_index()/last_valid_index() scanned the
materialized .values() Scalar Vec for the first/last non-missing position, then did labels()[i] (a
full IndexLabel Vec build for a lazy index) — two O(n) materializations for one label. Added an
all-valid fast path: if column.validity().all(), the first/last non-missing IS position 0 / len-1, so
return index_label_at(0)/index_label_at(len-1) (O(1) for an affine/typed index), skipping both
materializations. **Bit-identity provable**: on an all-valid column position 0 (resp. len-1) is the
first (resp. last) non-missing, and index_label_at(pos) == labels()[pos] (the idxmax helper); empty ->
None either way; a column WITH missing falls to the original loop. column.validity().all() is
precedented in fp-frame (line 15031). UNMEASURED — verify when disk recovers.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — skipna missing-checks -> hasnans() (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING disk-low)
DISK-LOW (38G, no cargo): code-only. 10 Series skipna reduction methods (sum/mean/min/max/prod/std/
var/sem_skipna + 2 more) gated their NaN-propagation branch on
`!skipna && self.column.values().iter().any(Scalar::is_missing)` — materializing the full Scalar Vec
even for Int64/Bool/Utf8 columns. Replaced with `!skipna && self.hasnans()` (the canonical optimized
check). **Bit-identity carefully verified**: `values().any(is_missing)` == hasnans() — hasnans returns
true on any validity-false bit (== a Null-materialized is_missing), else falls to the SAME
`values().any(is_missing)` for Float64/Datetime64/Timedelta64 (in-band NaN/NaT). CRUCIAL: I nearly
used `!validity().all()` instead, which would be a BUG — it misses in-band NaN/NaT that is_missing
catches (Float64 can carry a validity-true... no: NaN is validity-false, but the hasnans dtype-match
preserves the exact Scalar semantics; using hasnans is the safe equivalent, not validity().all()).
Win: hasnans skips materialization for all-valid Int64/Bool/Utf8 and early-returns on any null; only
applies to the uncommon skipna=false path, so MARGINAL but bit-identical + DRY. UNMEASURED.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — argmin/argmax typed Float64 path (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING disk-low)
DISK-LOW (38G, no cargo): code-only. Series.argmin/argmax (position of min/max) had a typed Int64
scan but FLOAT64 fell to the generic path: .values() Scalar Vec + per-element
compare_non_missing_scalars_for_sort dispatch. Added a typed Float64 branch mirroring the Int64 one
(scan &[f64], keep first strictly-smaller/larger). **Bit-identity provable**:
compare_non_missing_scalars_for_sort on two Float64 is `partial_cmp().unwrap_or(Equal)` (read &
confirmed; same as the idxmin/idxmax helpers at fp-frame:13383/13461), so `data[i] < data[best]`
(resp. `>`, IEEE) is exactly the Scalar path's `.is_lt()`/`.is_gt()`; as_f64_slice is all-valid AND
no-NaN, so no missing to skip and the first-occurrence tie-break is preserved. This is a GENUINE
(non-marginal) lever — argmin/argmax on float columns is common and currently materializes Scalars +
dispatches per element. UNMEASURED — verify when disk recovers.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — Series min()/max() typed Float64 path (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING) — IMPACTFUL
DISK-LOW (38G, no cargo): code-only. Series.min()/max() had SIMD Int64 paths (i64_slice_min/max_simd)
but FLOAT64 fell to the generic Scalar fold: .values() materialization + per-element to_f64() + compare.
min/max on float columns are among the MOST common reductions — a real, impactful gap. Added a typed
all-valid Float64 fast path scanning the native &[f64]. **Bit-identity carefully preserved**: the fold
uses `if v < result` / `if v > result` (NOT f64::min/max, which flip -0.0 vs +0.0) starting from
+/-INFINITY, EXACTLY as the Scalar loop; as_f64_slice is all-valid AND no-NaN so nothing is skipped;
empty -> NaN (matches the `found` flag). A Float64 column WITH missing/NaN falls to the generic fold
(skips missing) — bit-identical. (Deliberately did NOT use a SIMD f64 min/max helper: f64::min/max
would not match the Scalar path's `<`/`>` on -0.0.) UNMEASURED — verify when disk recovers.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — Series prod() typed Float64 path (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING disk-low)
DISK-LOW (38G, no cargo): code-only. Completes the reduction sweep: sum()/mean() were ALREADY typed
for Float64 (br-lei31, data.iter().sum()), min()/max() typed last commit, but prod() still fell to
the generic Scalar fold for Float64 (.values() + per-element to_f64 + multiply). Added a typed path
mirroring sum's: `data.iter().product()`. **Bit-identity provable**: Iterator::product is a 1.0-seeded
left-fold over the same f64 values in the same order as the generic `product *= to_f64(val)`;
as_f64_slice is all-valid so nothing is skipped — exactly as sum()'s typed path argues. Less common
than min/max/sum but a real gap, provably bit-identical. Series numeric reductions (sum/mean/min/max/
prod) are now ALL typed for Float64. UNMEASURED — verify when disk recovers.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — any()/all() typed Int64+Float64 paths (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING disk-low)
DISK-LOW (38G, no cargo): code-only. Series.any()/all() had a typed Bool fast path but NUMERIC columns
(Int64/Float64) fell to the .values() Scalar + per-element scalar_truthy scan. Added typed Int64
(`v != 0`) and Float64 (`v != 0.0`) paths. **Bit-identity provable**: scalar_truthy(Int64(v)) == v!=0
and scalar_truthy(Float64(v)) == (!is_nan && v!=0.0); as_i64_slice/as_f64_slice are all-valid and
as_f64_slice is no-NaN (so the is_nan guard is moot, and -0.0 != 0.0 is false == falsy, matching), no
missing to skip. Benefits DataFrame.any()/all() on numeric frames (per-column reduction). UNMEASURED
— verify when disk recovers. NOTE: verified the Series numeric/dedup family is now FULLY typed
(min/max/sum/prod/argmin/argmax/unique/nunique/mode/value_counts/quantile/var/any/all + cum*).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — GroupBy idxmin/idxmax typed Float64 path (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING)
DISK-LOW (38G, no cargo): code-only. SeriesGroupBy.idxmin()/idxmax() (per-group arg-extreme) scanned
the numeric branch via &self.series.column.values()[idx] (Scalar Vec materialization) + to_f64 per
element. Added a typed all-valid Float64 branch (before the Scalar else) scanning &[f64] directly.
**Bit-identity provable**: to_f64(Float64(v)) = v, same first-non-missing init + strictly-smaller/larger
update; as_f64_slice is all-valid AND no-NaN so nothing is skipped; a Float64 column with NaN/missing
falls to the Scalar else (skips missing) — consistent. Int64 deliberately NOT typed: the Scalar else
compares via to_f64 (i64→f64, lossy >2^53), so an i64 compare could differ — left as-is. Real lever —
groupby idxmin/idxmax on float is common ("row of the per-group max"). DataFrame reductions confirmed
to delegate to the now-typed Series methods (reduce_numeric → s.min/max/prod); ColumnData::Float64/
Int64/Bool are Arc<[T]> (O(1) clone) so column_as_series is cheap. UNMEASURED.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy any()/all() typed paths (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING disk-low)
DISK-LOW (38G, no cargo): code-only. Sweeping the GroupBy-closure vein (per-group agg uses
values()[idx] Scalar). SeriesGroupBy.any()/all() scanned each group via values()[idx] + is_missing +
scalar_truthy. Added typed Bool/Int64/Float64 branches (mirror of the Series.any()/all() fix this
session): all-valid groups scan the native &[bool]/&[i64]/&[f64] — scalar_truthy(Bool(b))==b,
(Int64)==v!=0, (Float64)==(!NaN && v!=0.0); typed slices all-valid (f64 no-NaN) so bit-identical, no
missing to skip. as_*_slice called inside the closure is O(1) per group. UNMEASURED. GroupBy vein
continues (idxmin/idxmax done last commit) — siblings (group first/last/nth, sum/mean if Scalar) next.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — agg_numeric fallback typed value-gather (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING) — IMPACTFUL
DISK-LOW (38G, no cargo): code-only. SeriesGroupBy.agg_numeric (backs groupby std/var/skew/kurt/sem/
median/quantile) has dense-key fast paths (int64-dense + contiguous-Utf8 grouping keys) that read
VALUES typed via vf/vi. But its general fallback (reached when the grouping KEY is Float64/Datetime/
sparse-Int64) built per-group `nums: Vec<f64>` via values()[idx] Scalar + per-row to_f64. Applied the
SAME vf/vi typed gather to the fallback: all-valid Float64 → data[idx]; all-valid Int64 → data[idx] as
f64. **Bit-identity provable**: the aggregate output is Float64, so to_f64(Int64(v))=v as f64 matches
the i64->f64 cast EXACTLY (no lossy-compare divergence — unlike idxmin, the values are converted to f64
in BOTH paths); to_f64(Float64)=v; all-valid ⇒ nothing missing to skip; a value column WITH missing
falls to the Scalar filter_map. Impactful: groupby moment/order-stat aggs over a non-dense key. UNMEASURED.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy first()/last() typed value column (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING)
DISK-LOW (38G, no cargo): code-only. Closes the GroupBy first/last gap. first()/last() materialized
the whole values() Scalar Vec, found the first/last non-missing index per group, then built a
Vec<Scalar> -> from_values. For an all-valid Float64/Int64 column, the first (resp. last) non-missing
IS indices[0] (resp. last index) — groups are never empty and every slot is valid. Added typed
branches: gather data[indices[0]]/data[last] into Vec<f64>/Vec<i64> -> from_f64_values/from_i64_values,
skipping BOTH the values() Scalar Vec AND the Scalar output build. **Bit-identity provable**:
grouped_value_or_null(Some(idx)) == values[idx].clone() == Scalar::Float64(data[idx]); from_f64_values
== from_values for all-finite f64 (as_f64_slice is no-NaN); from_i64_values == from_values for Int64;
labels = order (same as the per-i loop). A column with missing/NaN falls to the Scalar path. GroupBy
vein now: idxmin/idxmax, any/all, agg_numeric fallback, first/last — all typed. UNMEASURED.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — nlargest/nsmallest label gather via index_label_at (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING)
DISK-LOW (38G, no cargo): code-only. Series.nlargest/nsmallest/nlargest_keep gathered the result
labels via `.map(|(i,_)| self.index.labels()[*i].clone())` — labels() materializes the FULL
Vec<IndexLabel> (32B × total_rows) just to read the top-n. For nlargest(10) on a 1M-row RangeIndex
Series that's a 32MB materialization to read 10 labels. Converted the 5 selection-based sites to
self.index_label_at(*i) (O(1) per label for affine/typed-i64 indexes; bit-identical to labels()[pos],
proven in the idxmax fix j75z3). The (i,_) positions come from argsort/selection so are always
in-bounds. **SKIPPED iloc** (1 site): its positions are user-supplied and index_label_at computes
arithmetically without the bounds-check that labels()[pos] does, so converting could change OOB
behavior (panic→bogus label) — left as-is. Big win for nlargest(small_n) on large lazy-indexed Series.
UNMEASURED. (Extends the "labels()[pos] = O(n) materialization tax" SMELL from idxmax to GATHER paths.)

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — label_at() free fn for DataFrame/Series gather sites (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING)
DISK-LOW (38G, no cargo): code-only. Extends the labels()[pos]=O(n)-materialization fix to the
DataFrame gather sites (Series::index_label_at was impl-Series-only). Added a module-level free fn
label_at(&Index, pos) — identical proven body (RangeIndex arith / typed-i64 view / fallback),
bit-identical to index.labels()[pos].clone() for in-bounds pos. Converted 5 `.map(|&i| self.index.
labels()[i].clone())` gather sites: drop_duplicates_keep, to_string_table, drop, drop_rows_int,
compare. Each gathers a subset of self's own rows (in-bounds by construction), so each materialized
the FULL Vec<IndexLabel> just to read the kept rows — now O(1)/label for affine/typed indexes (no
materialization). Big win for these ops on large lazy/RangeIndex frames. (iloc still uses labels()[pos]
— user positions, OOB bounds-check concern, deliberately left.) UNMEASURED. Single-label sites
(explode 16553, etc.) are next-turn candidates.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — single-label labels()[i] reads -> label_at (CODE-ONLY, perf PENDING)
DISK-LOW (38G, no cargo): code-only. Swept the single-label per-row labels()[i]/[row].clone() reads
to the label_at(&self.index, ..) free fn (added last commit). 10 sites: first_valid_index/
last_valid_index (fallback loop), filter, explode, iterrows, itertuples, compare_with_align_axis,
explode_with_ignore_index (×3). All loop over self's own rows (0..len or self row_indices) so positions
are in-bounds; bit-identical to labels()[pos].clone(). For a lazy/RangeIndex these avoid materializing
the full Vec<IndexLabel> (n×32B) — label_at computes each arithmetically. SKIPPED iloc_with_columns
(`[position]`, user positions → OOB bounds-check concern) and the index_label_at/label_at fallback
bodies themselves. The labels()[pos]=O(n) SMELL (idxmax memory note) is now essentially closed across
single-label + gather + DataFrame sites. UNMEASURED. `&labels()[i]` borrow sites (34773/43252) need
restructuring (label_at returns owned) — deferred.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — FIX: duplicate iso_weeks_in_year (main was NOT compiling) — VERIFIED
DISK-LOW (warm per-crate build now allowed): ran `cargo build --offline -p fp-frame --release` (warm,
deps cached) to verify the ~25-commit code-only stack. FOUND a HARD COMPILE ERROR on main: E0592
duplicate definitions of `fn iso_weeks_in_year` (31710 from the weekofyear fast path + 32582 from the
isocalendar work — both byte-identical, same impl block). Introduced earlier in the dt vein (pre-this-
session) and never caught because no build ran. Deleted the second copy (both callers use the
survivor). **fp-frame now COMPILES (53.86s).** This means the entire pending dt/td/set_index/reduction/
GroupBy/label_at stack compiles. LESSON: code-only blind commits accumulated a latent dup-def; a warm
compile-check caught it. Disk 39G->37G after the build. NEXT: targeted warm benches for the big levers
(min/max f64, argmin/argmax, agg_numeric, label_at) when disk allows.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — measurement loop confirmed working (warm bench)
After the iso_weeks_in_year compile fix, built fp-bench (warm, 1m10s) and ran vs_pandas_harness.py:
- **groupby_count @1M: 6.87x FASTER** (real win, loop confirmed functional).
- dt_floor, groupby_agg_multi @1M: DROPPED_HIGH_CV (the known phantom-CV harness behavior — these
  are wins on clean MIN-of-fixed-iters per the harness-MIN rule; harness p50+CV drops them).
KEY GAP: the harness/fp-bench v1 workload set (groupby_agg_multi/count/transform, dt_floor, str_*,
join_*) does NOT cover this session's levers (set_index/total_seconds/min-max-f64/argmin-argmax/
GroupBy idxmin-first/any-all/agg_numeric-fallback/label_at). To MEASURE them, fp-bench workloads +
matching harness entries must be added (future task, needs disk for the iter loops). All levers remain
bit-identical by construction (verified compiling); perf is high-confidence-but-unmeasured. Disk 36G.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — dt vein MEASURED: 6-37x vs pandas @1M (clean MIN) — phantom-loss CONFIRMED
Clean-MIN methodology (run `fp-bench --category datetime --workload W --json` -> MIN of times_us;
pandas MIN of 20 fixed iters on a matched 1M datetime64 Series) — bypasses the harness DROPPED_HIGH_CV.
RESULTS @1M: dt_hour 37.5x, dt_minute 36.7x (pure rem_euclid time components), dt_year 7.7x,
dt_quarter 7.4x, dt_month 6.5x (Hinnant civil-arith calendar components). ALL big wins.
CRITICAL: these CONTRADICT the prior "at parity" harness reads (df-abs memory: month 1.04x, quarter
0.77x, dayofyear 0.91x) — those were harness p50+CV. Clean MIN shows 6.5x/7.4x. STRONGLY reconfirms
the PHANTOM-SATURATION rule: the harness p50+CV drastically understates fp's domination; always
re-measure MIN. The typed-datetime fast paths (civil_from_nanos + rem_euclid components, this session's
hardened weekofyear/dayofyear among them) genuinely dominate pandas' Python-level .dt accessors.
METHODOLOGY now reusable for the remaining PENDING levers once their fp-bench workloads exist.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — groupby vein MEASURED: 38-61x vs pandas @1M (clean MIN)
Clean-MIN (fp-bench --category groupby --json MIN vs pandas 12-iter MIN; setup matched: key=(col_0%100)
.astype(int64), groupby(key)[col_1].agg): groupby_first 60.6x, groupby_median 61.1x, groupby_max 48.2x,
groupby_std 37.9x @1M. The int64-key groupby aggregations dominate pandas overwhelmingly. groupby_first
(60.6x) exercises this session's SeriesGroupBy.first typed value-column path (int64-key dense agg, but
the per-group value gather is the typed code). NOTE: these int64 keys hit agg_numeric's DENSE path, not
the non-dense FALLBACK my agg_numeric fix targets (would need a Float64/Datetime grouping key to bench
that fallback). Combined with the dt vein (6.5-37.5x), fp measured-dominates pandas across dt+groupby.
No build (existing workloads). Disk 33G.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — pivot_table is a PHANTOM loss: 9.10x WIN @1M (clean MIN) — zngxi NOT needed
Clean-MIN (fp-bench df_pivot_table --json MIN vs pandas 12-iter MIN, matched: r=i%100, c=i%10, v=randn,
pivot_table(v,r,c,"mean")): @100k fp=6120us pandas=6290us = 1.03x (parity); @1M fp=6222us pandas=
56629us = **9.10x WIN**. The recorded "pivot_table 0.67x@1M loss" (bead zngxi, frontier map) was a
HARNESS p50+CV PHANTOM. fp's output is fixed 100x10 so it stays ~6.2ms while pandas scales with input
rows to 56.6ms @1M. **=> zngxi should be CLOSED — NO dense-int64 rewrite needed; pivot_table already
dominates.** CORRECTION to the post-sweep frontier map: pivot_table was listed as "the ONLY remaining
clearly-fixable loss" — it is NOT a loss. With pivot_table cleared, the benched fixable-loss set is
EMPTY; all remaining gaps are structural (transpose/stack/to_numpy 2D-block) or bit-locked (df_round).
Phantom-saturation now confirmed across dt + groupby + pivot_table on clean MIN.

## ═══ BOLD-VERIFY SCORECARD 2026-06-21 BlackThrush (disk recovered, clean-MIN vs pandas @1M) ═══
Profiled the full surface with clean-MIN (fp-bench --json MIN vs pandas fixed-iter MIN), bypassing the
harness's DROPPED_HIGH_CV. RESULT: **fp DOMINATES pandas across the ENTIRE winnable surface.**

WINS (clean MIN @1M):
- joins: inner 52.8x, left 27.3x, outer 5.8x
- groupby: first 60.6x, median 61.1x, max 48.2x, std 37.9x
- datetime: dt_hour 37.5x, dt_minute 36.7x, dt_year 7.7x, dt_quarter 7.4x, dt_month 6.5x
- value_counts: mid-card 3.7x, high-card 20.8x, wide-high 47.2x (low-card-100 ~0.91x near-parity)
- pivot_table: 9.1x (was the "0.67x loss" zngxi — PHANTOM, now cleared)

REMAINING LOSSES — ALL structurally unwinnable or bit-locked (NOT cheap levers):
- to_numpy: fp 2788us vs pandas **1us** — pandas returns its 2D BlockManager array as an O(1) VIEW;
  fp is columnar (m separate Arc<[f64]>) so it MUST materialize O(n*m). UNWINNABLE without 2D-block
  storage (architectural). A contiguous column-major buffer would cut fp-side ~3-5x but still lose.
- transpose: fp 80ms vs pandas 52us — same root (pandas block axis-swap view; fp builds n-col BTreeMap).
- ewm_mean: 0.79x — already typed (as_f64_slice); the per-element debias fdiv recurrence is bit-locked
  (changing it breaks goldens). DECLINED, confirmed.
- df_round: 0.84x — bit-locked (x*f).round_ties_even()/f fdiv.

PHANTOM-SATURATION reconfirmed HARD: the harness p50+CV understated EVERYTHING (joins "1.5x"->53x;
dt "parity"->37x; pivot_table "0.67x loss"->9x WIN). ALWAYS clean-MIN.

CONCLUSION: There is NO cheap winnable perf lever left — fp already dominates. The ONLY radical lever
that addresses a real loss is **2D-block storage for homogeneous-float frames** (makes to_numpy/
transpose/values O(1) views like pandas). This is a fundamental representation change (every op must
work with 2D-block storage) — too large for a safe single commit; FILED as a frontier bead. This turn's
deliverable is the rigorous gauntlet-grounded scorecard (negative evidence: winnable set exhausted).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — CONFORMANCE GREEN: session's ~25 levers verified bit-identical
cargo test --release -p fp-frame: **3097 passed; 0 failed** (15 ignored) + all integration test
binaries (value_counts_dense_conformance, differential harnesses, etc.) PASS, 0 failed. fp-conformance
smoke suite PASS. This verifies bit-identity of this session's full code-only stack: dt/td typed paths,
set_index (6 dtypes), min/max/sum/prod, argmin/argmax, searchsorted-i64, first/last_valid_index,
GroupBy idxmin/first/last/any-all, agg_numeric fallback, label_at (the iso_weeks_in_year dup-fix that
unblocked compilation included). BOLD-VERIFY LOOP COMPLETE: profiled (clean-MIN scorecard, fp dominates
5-60x), conformance GREEN, scorecard recorded, gaps identified (structural to_numpy/transpose = l4vzc
2D-block, bit-locked ewm/round). NEGATIVE EVIDENCE: no cheap winnable perf lever remains — the winnable
benched surface is exhausted (fp already dominates); the sole radical lever is architectural 2D-block
storage (l4vzc), too large for a safe single commit.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — EXHAUSTIVE clean-MIN scorecard: fp dominates ALL benched categories 5-239x
Extended the profile to every remaining category (io/rolling/expanding/indexing/df-moments/transform).
ALL WINS @1M clean-MIN: rolling_mean 31x, rolling_std 24x, expanding_sum 41x, df_skew 131x, df_sem 239x,
df_quantile 112x, df_interpolate 78x, groupby_transform_mean 69x, reindex 44x, csv_write 195x, csv_read
~1000x (CAVEAT: fp reads in-memory string vs pandas file+disk — inflated but still a clear win).
COMBINED with prior: joins 5.8-52.8x, groupby 38-61x, datetime 6.5-37.5x, value_counts 3.7-47x,
pivot_table 9.1x. ~25 ops profiled — EVERY winnable op DOMINATES pandas.
DEFINITIVE: the winnable benched surface is EXHAUSTIVELY confirmed dominated. The ONLY losses are
(a) structural — to_numpy 1us-view / transpose 52us-view / stack (pandas 2D BlockManager; fp columnar
must materialize O(n*m)) => bead l4vzc 2D-block storage, the SOLE radical lever, architectural; and
(b) bit-locked fdiv — ewm_mean 0.79x / df_round 0.84x (changing the recurrence/round breaks goldens).
NO cheap winnable lever exists. fp is alien-optimized to domination. Recommend l4vzc as a dedicated
trait-isolated effort (block storage + columnar fallback + golden isomorphism proof), not a blind commit.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — RADICAL LEVER SHIPPED: df_stack 0.32x LOSS -> 1.60x/21.3x WIN (MEASURED, conformance GREEN)
The exhaustive scorecard left exactly 3 real losses (to_numpy/transpose/stack) — all "structural". But
df_stack's loss was NOT the reshape itself: it built n*m separate IndexLabel::Utf8(String) composite
labels via format! per cell (the explicit "pandas dodges this with a MultiIndex" note in the code).
LEVER: build the composite labels into ONE contiguous Utf8 byte buffer + offsets (row part formatted
ONCE per row, reused across m cols) and construct the index via Index::from_utf8_contiguous — instead
of n*m String allocs + Index::new(Vec<IndexLabel>). The composite bytes are BYTE-IDENTICAL to the old
format!("{row}|{col}"); from_utf8_contiguous yields the same labels() (flat composite-string model, NO
MultiIndex change, NO golden regen).
MEASURED @1M clean-MIN: df_stack 0.32x -> **1.60x @100k, 21.3x @1M** (fp-side 64677us -> ~12000us, 5.3x
faster — the n*m String allocs eliminated). CONFORMANCE GREEN: fp-frame 3098 passed/0 failed incl.
dataframe_stack_golden_basic + stack/unstack roundtrip + series_unstack goldens. This flips one of the
3 "structural" losses into a WIN, bit-identically. (to_numpy/transpose remain genuine 2D-block
structural — l4vzc.) LESSON: a "structural composite-string" loss can be ALLOC-bound, not
representation-bound — contiguous-Utf8 index buffer is the lever (cf. the melt/value_counts contiguous
patterns). Committed via git apply --cached (stack hunks ONLY; other agents' WIP in the shared tree left untouched).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — FINAL exhaustive sweep (~45 ops): fp dominates ALL but to_numpy/transpose
Swept every remaining workload clean-MIN @1M. ALL WIN: df_diff 104x, df_shift 62x, df_pct_change 307x,
df_ffill 253x, df_fillna 52x, df_isna 136x, df_idxmax 13x, df_count 16519x (lazy validity),
df_mode 48x, describe 127x, rank 322x, df_duplicated 146x, df_melt 80x, df_nlargest 18x, df_cumprod
212x, df_sort_index 69680x (is_monotonic short-circuit), sort_values 31x, filter_bool 24x,
drop_duplicates 1413x, loc_labels 117x. NO losses.
DEFINITIVE FINAL SCORECARD (~45 ops, every category): fp DOMINATES pandas 5x-69680x on EVERYTHING
EXCEPT to_numpy (fp 2788us vs pandas 1us O(1)-block-view) and transpose (fp 80ms vs pandas 52us). Both
are GENUINELY structural — verified NO alloc-bound sub-issue (transpose's n-column BTreeMap IS the
n-wide output; to_numpy's n*m copy vs pandas' zero-copy block view). Unlike df_stack (which I flipped
0.32x->21x by replacing n*m String allocs with a contiguous-Utf8 index), to_numpy/transpose cannot be
won without 2D-block storage for homogeneous frames => bead l4vzc, architectural (trait-isolated block
storage + columnar fallback + golden isomorphism). THE WINNABLE SURFACE IS EXHAUSTED AND DOMINATED.
Every memory "loss" (value_counts 0.62x, ewm 0.79x, round 0.84x, pivot_table 0.67x, stack 0.32x) was
EITHER a harness phantom (clean-MIN wins) OR now-fixed (stack). Only l4vzc remains.

### 2026-06-21 cod-b — br-frankenpandas-90qpl: DataFrame.nlargest typed top-k heap WIN
Targeted the remaining p50 loss in `df.nlargest(100, "col_0")` at 100k rows: the typed DataFrame
path avoided gathering every row, but still built a full typed sort permutation before slicing the
first 100 positions. Lever: for all-valid Int64/Float64 single-key `nlargest`/`nsmallest`, maintain a
bounded worst-first heap for very small `n` (<=1024), or partial-select for larger but still sparse
top-k, then sort only the selected prefix with a `(value, input-position)` comparator. This preserves
`sort_values(column, asc).head(n)` tie order and keeps NaN/mixed/large-n fallback paths unchanged.

Measured with the repo `fp-bench` workload and matched pandas oracle data (`float64`, 10 columns,
seed 42; p50 microseconds; FP release-perf binary in `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`):

| Size | Before FP p50 | After FP p50 | Pandas p50 | Ratio vs pandas | FP speedup |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 100k | 4906.41 us | 690.17 us | 1365.50 us | 1.98x WIN | 7.11x |
| 1M | 46015.76 us | 3377.68 us | 76365.96 us | 22.61x WIN | 13.62x |

Scorecard: wins 2, losses 0, neutral 0. No regression hunk reverted because both measured sizes moved
from full-sort overhead to decisive wins. Validation: `cargo fmt -p fp-frame --check` PASS;
`rch exec -- cargo test -p fp-frame dataframe_topk_ties_preserve_input_order_90qpl --release -- --nocapture`
PASS; `rch exec -- cargo test -p fp-frame dataframe_nlargest_row_integrity_r5k8q --release -- --nocapture`
PASS; `rch exec -- cargo test -p fp-conformance --release -- --nocapture` PASS (1595 unit tests plus
integration/property/smoke tests green; live-oracle checks skipped where the worker lacks the legacy
pandas checkout); local fallback `cargo clippy -p fp-frame --all-targets --release -- -D warnings`
PASS after remote clippy reported the pinned nightly clippy component missing; `cargo check -p fp-frame
--all-targets --release` PASS. UBS bounded scan on `crates/fp-frame/src/lib.rs` hit the documented
180s large-file timeout without emitting a finding.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — explode is a WIN (2.84x-43.8x), not a loss; df_explode bench added
DUG the un-benched reshape ops (after cod-a's concat loss showed losses exist outside the curated set).
Hypothesis: Series.explode(sep) has the unoptimized melt-pattern (Vec<Scalar::Utf8(String)> per output
cell, no perf bead). MEASURED via a new df_explode workload (Series of "aN,bN,cN", pandas
s.str.split(",").explode()): @100k fp=12657us pandas=35991us = **2.84x WIN**; @1M fp=12318us pandas=
539954us = **43.8x WIN**. So explode is NOT a loss — pandas' str.split().explode() is slow enough that
fp wins despite the Scalar allocs. 2.84x@100k is the WEAKEST margin measured. A contiguous-Utf8 fix
(from_utf8_values_with_validity, bit-identical — from_values normalizes the NullKind::NaN empty-part
to the dtype-standard Utf8 null) would push it higher, but it's a WIN not a loss, the gain is modest
(~2x), and ValidityMask has no clean from_bools — deferred (not mandate-priority). Added df_explode as
a permanent regression-guard bench. SCORECARD now ~46 ops, ALL win except to_numpy(bench-only)/transpose
(l4vzc architectural). NO more cheaply-winnable loss exists in MY domain (concat/construction = cod-a).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — df.dot WINS vs OpenBLAS (3.66-9.41x); scorecard DEFINITIVELY complete (~47 ops)
Measured df.dot — the ONE op where fp deliberately forgoes C BLAS/LAPACK (per the no-gaps mandate's
pure-safe-Rust constraint): @100k(dim316) fp 1088us vs pandas/OpenBLAS 3983us = 3.66x; @1M(dim1000) fp
1086us vs 10221us = 9.41x WIN. fp's safe-Rust blocked GEMM beats BLAS at benched sizes (pandas'
DataFrame->numpy->BLAS->DataFrame overhead dominates; df_dot fp time is partly setup per the earlier
uza04.149 note). So even the no-C-BLAS op WINS.
=== DEFINITIVE COMPLETE SCORECARD (~47 ops, every category, clean-MIN @1M) ===
fp DOMINATES pandas on EVERY benched op 2.84x-69680x EXCEPT: to_numpy (bench-only, no real caller) +
transpose (architectural 2D-block, l4vzc). Both need block storage; everything else — joins, groupby,
datetime, value_counts, pivot_table, stack(FIXED 557a5484), explode, rolling, skew/sem/quantile,
interpolate, reindex, csv, the elementwise family, AND df.dot/GEMM — WINS. Every memory/hypothesized
"loss" (value_counts/ewm/round/pivot_table/stack/explode/dot) was a harness phantom or now fixed or a
clean win. THE WINNABLE PERF SURFACE IS EXHAUSTED AND COMPREHENSIVELY DOMINATED. Sole remaining levers:
l4vzc (transpose/to_numpy, architectural — me) and construction/concat-class (cod-a, in progress).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — LEVER SHIPPED: explode contiguous-Utf8 — 2.84x->6.46x@100k, 43.8x->97.8x@1M (bit-identical)
Strengthened fp's WEAKEST domination margin (explode 2.84x@100k). Series.explode(sep) built a
Vec<Scalar::Utf8(String)> per output cell (the melt-pattern — each part allocated TWICE: in the Scalar,
then again in from_values' buffer). LEVER (melt/stack family): all-valid contiguous-Utf8 source builds
the exploded VALUE column straight into a byte buffer + offsets, with ValidityMask::from_invalid_ranges
for the (rare) empty-trimmed-part nulls. **Bit-identical**: same s.split(sep) parts; an empty trimmed
part -> null (the old Scalar::Null(NullKind::NaN) is normalized by from_values to the dtype-standard
Utf8 null = a validity-false slot); empty source cell -> one valid "" row. MEASURED: @100k 2.84x->
**6.46x** (fp 12657->5384us, 2.35x faster fp-side); @1M 43.8x->**97.8x** (fp 12318->5622us). CONFORMANCE
GREEN: fp-frame 3098/0 incl. series_explode_with_nulls (validates the null path) + both explode goldens.
The weakest-margin op is now a strong win. Pattern reconfirmed: melt/stack/explode long-output reshapes
= ALLOC-bound on Scalar::Utf8 -> contiguous-Utf8 buffer is the lever.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — apply_str contiguous fast path REGRESSED (reverted); str ops win 12-174x
Hypothesis: apply_str (backs zfill/pad/repeat/slice/replace/strip/title/... — every Utf8-output str
accessor) materializes the source values() (Vec<Scalar::Utf8>) before mapping, so a contiguous-Utf8
fast path (pass spans straight to func as &str, like apply_str_int's rung 3) would skip 1M source
allocs. MEASURED: it REGRESSED 10-18% — str_zfill 7645->8542us (0.90x), str_pad 7844->9294us (0.84x),
str_repeat 2677->3171us (0.84x). REVERTED. NEGATIVE EVIDENCE: values() for a contiguous Utf8 column is
already cheap (cached/optimized iterator); the source materialization was NOT the bottleneck, and the
per-element std::str::from_utf8 validation + bounds-checked span slicing ADDED overhead. (Distinct from
apply_str_int where the typed-Int64 output build is the win — for apply_str the OUTPUT Scalar::Utf8 +
from_values dominates, and the source read is already fast.) Added str_zfill/pad/repeat regression-guard
benches: str ops WIN 12.5x/11.9x/145.7x vs pandas (pandas str accessors are Python-level). Conclusion:
str ops are strong wins; apply_str is not a lever. Weakest margins now: join_outer 5.8x, explode 6.46x
(both fixed/strong). No loss remains except to_numpy(bench-only)/transpose(l4vzc).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — dt string-output helpers contiguous (date/time/strftime +8%); benches added
The 3 String-returning dt helpers (typed_datetime_{civil,nanos,full}_string_component_all_valid —
backing dt.date/time/strftime) built Vec<Scalar::Utf8> + from_values. Replaced with a contiguous byte
buffer + offsets (extend the component's String bytes) -> from_utf8_contiguous, skipping the
n-element Scalar Vec + from_values re-validation. **Bit-identical** (from_utf8_contiguous == from_values
for all-valid; NaT bails). MEASURED: dt_date 10904->9993us, dt_strftime 45380->41939us (both ~8% fp-side,
date 10.4->11.8x, strftime 9.0->9.5x vs pandas). Conformance GREEN (fp-frame 3098/0). MODEST (8%) — the
component's format! String alloc still dominates; a bigger win needs write!-into-buffer (avoid the String
alloc), but that's per-format specialized (deferred). These were already WINS (pandas dt string accessors
are Python-level); this strengthens them. Added dt_strftime/dt_date regression-guard benches. dt string
ops confirmed WINS — no loss. Surface stands: dominated except to_numpy(bench-only)/transpose(l4vzc).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — LEVER: dt.date write!-into-buffer — 10.4x->17.4x (1.66x fp-side, bit-identical)
Follow-up to the dt string helper contiguous fix (which removed the Vec<Scalar> but left the per-row
format! String alloc as the dominant cost). dt.date now formats "YYYY-MM-DD" with `write!` DIRECTLY
into the output byte buffer (Vec<u8> via io::Write), avoiding the format! String allocation entirely.
**Bit-identical**: write! with the same "{y:04}-{m:02}-{d:02}" spec emits identical bytes; bails to the
generic helper on NaT/non-dense. MEASURED: dt_date 9993->6557us (1.52x over the helper, 1.66x over the
10904us original) -> **17.36x vs pandas** (was 10.4x). Conformance GREEN (fp-frame 3098/0). Confirms the
format! String alloc was the dominant cost. PATTERN: fixed-format dt/string output -> write!-into-buffer
beats format!+Scalar+from_values. (time/strftime are candidates — time has a fixed "HH:MM:SS" format;
strftime is user-format so needs the formatter refactored to write into a buffer.)

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — LEVER: dt.time write!-into-buffer (36.7x vs pandas); dt_time bench added
Applied the dt.date write! lever to dt.time: format "HH:MM:SS" with write! directly into the output
byte buffer (same secs_of_day/h/mi/sec integer formulas + format spec as the helper closure), avoiding
the per-row format! String alloc. Bit-identical (write! == format! bytes; bails on NaT). MEASURED:
dt_time fp=5496us vs pandas 201732us = **36.71x** (pandas dt.time builds Python datetime.time objects —
very slow); dt_date 17.53x. Conformance GREEN (fp-frame 3098/0). Added dt_time bench (step = 1day+37s so
date AND time-of-day both vary). The fixed-format-dt write!-into-buffer vein: date(17.4x)+time(36.7x)
done; strftime is user-format (needs the formatter refactored to write into a buffer — deferred);
day_name/month_name already return &'static str (no alloc).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — RADICAL LEVER: strftime token-parse + write! — 9.5x->51.2x (5.47x fp-side)
strftime's closure did SIX CHAINED `.replace()` PER ROW (`fmt.replace("%Y",..).replace("%m",..)...`) —
each a full format re-scan + String allocation (~12 allocs/row = ~12M allocs/sec @1M). That was the
42ms. LEVER: pre-parse the format into literal/directive tokens ONCE, then write! each token DIRECTLY
into the output byte buffer per row — ZERO per-row allocations. **Bit-identical**: same six directives
(%Y/%m/%d/%H/%M/%S) zero-padded the same way, everything else literal; digit replacements never create
new directives so left-to-right token substitution == chained .replace(). MEASURED: dt_strftime
41939->7664us (5.47x vs the helper, 5.92x vs the 45380us original) -> **51.18x vs pandas** (was 9.5x).
CONFORMANCE GREEN: fp-frame 3098/0 incl. tests::dt_strftime (validates the token parser). The
write!-into-buffer dt-string vein COMPLETE: date 17.4x, time 36.7x, strftime 51.2x — all bit-identical,
all from killing the per-row format!/replace String allocs. RADICAL: chained per-row .replace() is the
worst alloc pattern; pre-parse + write! is the lever.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — day_name/month_name contiguous static-byte write (293x/80x); dt-string vein COMPLETE
The 2 &'static str dt helpers (typed_datetime_{civil,nanos}_str_component_all_valid — backing
dt.month_name/day_name) did Scalar::Utf8(component(...).to_string()) — a per-row .to_string() ALLOC of
the static name + Vec<Scalar> + from_values. Replaced with extend_from_slice(component(...).as_bytes())
into a contiguous byte buffer -> from_utf8_contiguous (no per-row alloc; the component returns a &'static
str so its bytes copy directly). Bit-identical (same names; NaT bails). MEASURED: dt_day_name fp=439us =
**293.81x** vs pandas, dt_month_name fp=1325us = **80.11x**. Conformance GREEN (fp-frame 3098/0 incl.
tests::dt_day_name + dt_month_name). Added both benches. THE dt-STRING write!/contiguous VEIN IS NOW
COMPLETE: date 17.4x, time 36.7x, strftime 51.2x (RADICAL), day_name 293x, month_name 80x — every dt
Utf8-output op now emits straight into a contiguous buffer with zero per-row String allocs.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — astype(str) is a WIN (i64 26.9x, f64 35.9x); bench added, no fix
Dug numeric->string conversion (the broader per-row String-alloc class beyond dt). Series.astype(Utf8)
goes through Column::astype -> .map(cast_scalar(v, Utf8)).collect() -> Vec<Scalar::Utf8> + from_values
(alloc-bound). MEASURED via new astype_str_i64/f64 benches: i64 fp=5602us = **26.93x**, f64 fp=13464us
= **35.85x** vs pandas (pandas astype(str) is Python-level per-element formatting). So astype(str) is a
WIN, not a loss. A contiguous write!-into-buffer fix would strengthen it (~2x like the dt ops) BUT: (1)
it's cross-crate (fp-columnar Column::astype), and (2) cast_scalar's Utf8 output matches pandas-specific
string spellings (float "1.0", bool "True"/"False" — see test astype_to_utf8_uses_pandas_string_spellings),
so replicating it with write! risks a float-formatting bit-identity break. NOT pursued (win, not loss;
risk > reward). Added astype_str benches as regression guards. The clean in-fp-frame dt-string write!
vein is harvested (date/time/strftime/day_name/month_name); numeric->string is a cross-crate win.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — LEVER: Int64 astype(str) write!-into-buffer — 26.9x->90.1x (3.33x fp-side)
Followed the astype(str) measurement: i64 was 26.9x (a win, but the alloc-bound cast_scalar path). The
INT case is SAFE to write! (cast_scalar(Int64(v), Utf8) == v.to_string(), pandas spells ints plainly —
verified vs test cast_scalar_to_utf8_uses_pandas_string_spellings: -7->"-7"). Added an all-valid
Int64->Utf8 fast path to Column::astype (fp-columnar, mirroring the existing Int64->Float64 / Float64->
Int64 typed casts): write! each integer straight into a contiguous byte buffer -> from_utf8_contiguous,
skipping the Vec<Scalar> source materialization AND the per-row String alloc. MEASURED: astype_str_i64
5602->1684us (3.33x fp-side) -> **90.10x vs pandas** (was 26.9x). CONFORMANCE GREEN: fp-columnar 436/0
(incl. astype_to_utf8 spelling test) + fp-frame 3098/0. DELIBERATELY NOT float/bool (cast_scalar uses
pandas-specific spellings "1.0"/"True" that Rust's {} does NOT produce — write! would break them). The
write!-into-buffer vein extends to numeric->string for the safe int case.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — LEVER: Bool astype(str) static-byte write (347x); completes safe astype-str cases
Sibling of the Int64 astype(str) lever. cast_scalar(Bool(b), Utf8) is exactly "True"/"False" (pandas
spellings, verified by the spelling test), so a Bool->Utf8 fast path in Column::astype emits those static
bytes straight into a contiguous buffer (like day_name) — bit-identical, skips Vec<Scalar::Utf8>.
MEASURED: astype_str_bool fp=331us = **347.57x** vs pandas. Conformance GREEN (fp-columnar incl. astype
spelling test). The SAFE astype(str) cases are now all typed-fast: Int64 90.1x, Bool 347x. Float64
DEFERRED (35.9x win; cast_scalar's float formatter is the complex pandas repr — shortest-round-trip +
".0" + scientific threshold — too risky to replicate write-into-buffer bit-identically).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — LEVER: Float64 astype(str) via CALLING the formatter — 35.9x->61.5x; astype(str) COMPLETE
Found the SAFE way to do the float case I'd deferred: instead of REPLICATING cast_scalar's complex
pandas float repr with write! (risky), made fp_types::float_to_string_for_astype pub (1-line, additive)
and CALL it from a Column::astype Float64->Utf8 fast path — extending its bytes into a contiguous buffer.
Skips the source Scalar::Float64 Vec + the output Scalar::Utf8 Vec + from_values (the formatter's own
String alloc remains). **Bit-identical** (same fn cast_scalar uses — the float spelling test
astype_to_utf8_uses_pandas_string_spellings PASSES). as_f64_slice is all-valid+no-NaN so the formatter's
NaN branch isn't reached (NaN columns take the Scalar map -> "nan"); inf handled. MEASURED: astype_str_f64
13464->7923us (1.70x fp-side) -> **61.54x** vs pandas (was 35.9x). CONFORMANCE GREEN: fp-columnar 436/0
+ fp-frame 3098/0. astype(str) is now COMPLETE: Int64 90.1x, Bool 347x, Float64 61.5x — all bit-identical.
LESSON: when a formatter is too complex to replicate write-into-buffer, CALL it (avoid the Scalar Vecs +
from_values) for a safe ~1.7-2x; only the formatter's own String alloc remains.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — FINDING (filed, not rushed): to_csv/ffill_axis n*m BTreeMap-per-cell smell
Profiling the string-output ops surfaced a real inefficiency: DataFrame::to_csv (+ to_csv_options/full)
and ffill_axis/bfill_axis do `self.columns[name].values()[row_idx]` PER CELL — an n*m BTreeMap lookup +
per-cell values(), the EXACT smell to_numpy's br-tonp1 already fixed (pre-resolve columns once). Fix:
hoist col_values (or a typed F/I/B/U enum) before the row loop. BUT the 3 to_csv variants are near-
duplicates (to_csv_options uses a column SUBSET + na_rep, not self.column_order), so a blind replace_all
is unsafe — needs a careful per-variant pass. to_csv is already a WIN (195x) so it's a strengthen, not a
loss; FILED as a bead for a dedicated pass rather than rushing a fiddly multi-variant edit on winning
ops. (Discipline: identified + filed > risky rushed commit.) The clean high-value string-output veins
(dt accessors, astype int/bool/float, stack/explode) are harvested + shipped this campaign.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — to_csv BTreeMap hoist = ~0-gain (REVERTED); the formatter is the cost
Tested the filed to_csv n*m BTreeMap-hoist hypothesis (br-3seq1): pre-resolved col_values once before
the row loop (to_numpy tonp1 pattern). MEASURED: csv_write 49271us vs 49242us baseline = **1.00x, NO
gain**. REVERTED (~0-gain churn; conformance was green but no benefit). NEGATIVE EVIDENCE: the n*m
BTreeMap lookup + cached values() was already cheap — NOT the bottleneck. The real cost is the per-cell
format_pandas_csv_float(*v) String alloc + push_str (the bench is a float frame). The only real lever
is write!-ing the formatter output into the `out` accumulator (avoid the formatter String), but pandas-
CSV float formatting (.0 suffix/precision) is complex to replicate bit-identically — and to_csv is
already a WIN (196x). Sibling to the apply_str revert: the suspected source/lookup overhead was a
phantom; the OUTPUT formatting alloc is the real cost. br-3seq1 updated with this measurement.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — DEFINITIVE CAMPAIGN SCORECARD: all shipped levers hold (no regression)
Consolidated re-measurement of every lever shipped this campaign (clean-MIN @1M vs pandas, WITH pandas
warmup): df_stack 1.67x@100k/20.63x@1M, explode 149x, dt_date 16.2x, dt_time 34.4x, dt_strftime 51.2x,
dt_day_name 267x, dt_month_name 76x, astype_str_i64 83.5x, astype_str_bool 379x, astype_str_f64 57.2x.
ALL HOLD — no regression from the multi-agent churn. NOTE/LESSON: an initial it=6 NO-WARMUP pandas pass
showed df_stack at a spurious 0.4x (pandas 2.2 DataFrame.stack first runs were anomalously fast / the
FutureWarning machinery skews early iters); WITH 2 warmup calls + 20 iters it is a clean 1.67x/20.63x
WIN. => clean-MIN methodology MUST warm pandas for variable ops (stack/pivot). The campaign's
write!-into-buffer + call-the-formatter vein (per-row String alloc -> contiguous buffer) is fully
harvested across dt accessors + reshape + astype(str int/bool/float); reverted phantoms apply_str +
to_csv-BTreeMap-hoist (output-formatting alloc, not source/lookup, is always the real cost); deferred
br-3seq1 (to_csv float-formatter-into-accumulator, to_csv near-optimal at 5ns/field/196x) + l4vzc
(transpose/to_numpy architectural). Surface dominates pandas 1.67x-69680x except to_numpy(bench-only).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — CORRECTION: pivot_table @small IS a real loss (warmup); zngxi REOPENED
The warmup discipline (from the df_stack artifact) caught a prior ERROR: I had closed zngxi calling
pivot_table a phantom (1.03x@100k/9.1x@1M, NO-warmup). WITH pandas warmup: df_pivot_table 0.25x@10k,
1.00x@100k, 8.80x@1M — a REAL LOSS at small/medium input. fp is INPUT-INDEPENDENT ~6.1ms (6252/6062/
6089us @10k/100k/1M) while pandas SCALES (1544/6069/53609us). So fp has a ~6ms FIXED overhead for a
100x10 output — the O(n_rows) scans (unique idx/col + scatter into HashMap<(ScalarKey,ScalarKey),
Vec<f64>>) are sub-ms even @1M, so a fixed setup/alloc cost dominates. ROOT CAUSE needs a flamegraph
(candidates: ScalarKey HashMap vs int64-dense direct-address grouping; per-cell Vec<f64> alloc; output
Scalar-Vec build). REOPENED zngxi with this; likely fix = int64-dense grouping (cf groupby 1432b615).
INTEGRITY NOTE: two prior "phantom" closures (pivot_table, and the df_stack 0.4x) were NO-WARMUP
artifacts — clean-MIN MUST warm pandas for variable ops; I'm re-auditing reshape ratios accordingly.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — PROFILED pivot_table (instrumented): scatter ~4ms dominant, INPUT-INDEPENDENT
Instrumented pivot_table phases (timers added + reverted): uniq+sort ~1.9ms, SCATTER ~4ms (dominant),
output ~0.1ms — ALL input-independent (10k~=100k~=1M ~6ms total). So the cost is NOT O(n_rows) hashing
(would scale) but per-row fixed-ish overhead: scatter = HashMap<(ScalarKey,ScalarKey),Vec<f64>> via
per-row entry+push, keys from idx_col.values()[i]/col_col.values()[i] (Scalar materialize + ScalarKey
wrap per row) + val_col.values()[i].to_f64(). zngxi updated with the profiled breakdown + a MEASURABLE
fix plan (int64-dense scatter: as_i64_slice -> dense sum[cell]+count[cell] flat array, no HashMap/no
per-cell Vec, for mean/sum/count/min/max; ScalarKey fallback for median/std). CRITICAL per the to_csv-
hoist lesson: the input-independence is anomalous (hashing would scale) — so VERIFY the typed-slice
access is the win before assuming, don't guess. This is the disciplined profile-then-fix the mandate
asks (/profiling-software-performance): perf/valgrind are restricted here, so source timers were used.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — pivot_table values()-hoist: REAL +13% (shipped); scatter still open
Profiling-led PARTIAL win on the pivot_table @small loss (zngxi): the unique-collection + scatter loops
called idx_col/cols_col/val_col .values() PER ROW (n_rows x ~3 calls, 2 loops each). Hoisted to once-per-
column (bit-identical cached Scalar slice). MEASURED ~13%: 6100->~5300us => 0.25x->0.31x@10k, 1.01x->
1.24x@100k, 8.56x->10.19x@1M. Conformance GREEN (pivot 37/0, unstack 7/0). So the per-row values()
dispatch WAS ~750us — a genuine (if partial) cost, UNLIKE the to_csv-hoist phantom. REMAINING ~5.3ms is
the SCATTER (ScalarKey HashMap + per-cell Vec) — zngxi's int64-dense scatter is the next lever (open).
LESSON: hoisting a per-row .values() out of a loop is a safe bit-identical micro-lever worth checking on
any hot per-row-Scalar-access path (cf the labels()[pos] materialization-tax smell).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — pivot_table FIXED: FxHashMap scatter + values()-hoist = ~47% (zngxi CLOSED)
The remaining pivot_table scatter cost was std SipHash: 'groups' was the one HashMap (vs the FxHashSet
unique-collection) left on the default hasher. Switched to FxHashMap => ~40% on top of the values()-hoist
+13%. COMBINED 6100->3220us (~47%): 0.25x->0.48x@10k, 1.0x->2.00x@100k (WIN), 8.8x->16.47x@1M. Bit-
identical (output ordered by sorted col/idx keys, not HashMap iteration; each cell written once).
Conformance GREEN (pivot 37/0). zngxi CLOSED — no int64-dense rewrite needed. KEY LESSON: the "input-
independent ~6ms" that looked like a fixed cost was measurement noise masking the SipHash scaling; the
scatter (ScalarKey,ScalarKey) SipHash WAS the dominant cost. ALWAYS check for a stray std HashMap on a
hot per-row path when FxHashMap is already the crate convention.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — df_pivot: same pivot_table smell, FxHashMap+hoist ~2x (output-build next)
Applied the pivot_table lesson to DataFrame::pivot (added a df_pivot bench: unique r=i/10,c=i%10 since
pivot errors on dups). BASELINE was catastrophic: 0.03x@10k / 0.24x@100k / 2.62x@1M (fp ~22-25ms flat).
pivot had the IDENTICAL smell: per-row idx_vals/col_vals/val_vals.values()[i] in the scatter + a std-
SipHash `cells: HashMap` used for BOTH the scatter inserts AND the per-output-cell gets. Hoisted values()
+ FxHashMap => ~2x: 0.07x@10k / 0.39x@100k / 5.47x@1M (fp ~11-13ms). Bit-identical (output ordered by
sorted row_keys/col_keys; cells only probed by get/contains), conformance GREEN (pivot 37/0). STILL a
loss @small — remaining ~11ms is the OUTPUT BUILD (for col {for row {cells.get}} -> Vec<Scalar> ->
Column::new), the melt Scalar-output smell (typed from_f64_values + NaN-for-missing is the next lever).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — crosstab FxHashMap ~25% (br-1q4q4 #2); @100k now parity
Third FxHashMap-on-hot-path win (after pivot_table, pivot). DataFrame::crosstab had THREE std-SipHash
hashers: seen_cols (HashSet), counts (nested HashMap<String,HashMap<String,i64>> — the per-row tally),
col_idx_of (HashMap, output). Added a df_crosstab bench (a=i%100,b=i%10). Baseline 0.28x@10k/0.80x@100k/
8.12x@1M (fp ~9450us flat). Converted all 3 to Fx => ~25%: 0.37x@10k / 1.03x@100k (parity) / 10.64x@1M.
Bit-identical (col_keys/row_keys are first-seen/sorted ordered lists; the maps/sets are only probed by
entry/insert/get). Conformance GREEN. Remaining flat ~7ms = the per-row String stringification (rk_str/
ck_str per row — INTENTIONAL for the Int64(5)==Utf8("5") merge quirk; could cache the <=cardinality
distinct stringifications but the quirk constrains it). get_dummies still a candidate (br-1q4q4 #3).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — series_map (Series.map) FxHashMap ~41%; 4th FxHashMap-lever win
Series::map_series built `lookup: std::collections::HashMap<IndexLabel,&Scalar>` (std SipHash) from the
mapper, then did per-row gets. Added a series_map bench. Baseline 0.07x@10k / 0.34x@100k / 3.51x@1M (fp
~3040us flat — SipHash). lookup -> FxHashMap => ~41%: 0.10x@10k / 0.59x@100k / 5.94x@1M. Bit-identical
(output in self's order; map only probed by get). Conformance GREEN. Remaining ~1785us = per-row
IndexLabel construction (val->IndexLabel per row) + Vec<Scalar> output. FOUR FxHashMap wins this session:
pivot_table ~47%, pivot ~2x, crosstab ~25%, series_map ~41% — the std-HashMap-on-per-row-path lever.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — RADICAL: Series.unstack was O(N^2) -> O(N) (@10k: timeout>30s -> 19ms)
Profiling the FxHashMap candidates surfaced a CATASTROPHIC algorithmic loss: Series::unstack's output
build did `for col { for row { entries.iter().find(|(r,c,_)| r==rk && c==ck) } }` — a linear scan of ALL
N entries PER output cell = O(R*C*N) = O(N^2) (N=R*C), with String comparisons. df_unstack @10k TIMED OUT
(>30s; the bench's 28 calls each ~1s+); @1M would be hours. FIX: build a cell_map (row,col)->value ONCE
(FxHashMap, FIRST-wins to match find's first-match), then O(1) per cell => O(N). Also row_seen/col_seen
HashSet -> FxHashSet. RESULT: @10k timeout->18935us, @100k->19931us, @1M->20705us (2.21x win). Bit-
identical (conformance unstack 7/0). STILL a loss @small (0.02x@10k/0.18x@100k) — remaining ~19ms flat is
the per-row String key construction (key_str format + split_once + 2 String clones into entries) + the
Vec<Scalar> output (melt smell). LESSON: the FxHashMap-candidate scan also catches O(N^2) entries.find
loops — `.iter().find()` inside a per-cell loop is the quadratic smell (cf the broader scan-and-find
quadratic family). The O(N^2)->O(N) is the radical win; the String/output is a follow-up.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — unstack O(N^2) magnitude QUANTIFIED: 14.3s -> 19ms @10k (~750x)
A delayed background baseline (pre-fix binary) captured the exact pre-fix cost: df_unstack @10k =
14,302,014us (14.3 SECONDS) vs pandas 475us = 0.00003x (~30,000x slower). Post-fix (commit 061704bd,
O(N^2)->O(N) cell_map): 18,935us (19ms) = ~750x FP-side speedup; the O(N^2) entries.iter().find-per-cell
made it effectively unbounded at 1M (hours). Confirms unstack was UNUSABLE at any real scale before the
fix. (The earlier ledger entry recorded only ">30s timeout"; this is the precise number.)

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — DataFrame.get_dummies FxHashSet/Map ~37%; wide-reshape sweep COMPLETE
5th FxHashMap-family win. DataFrame::get_dummies had std-SipHash seen_set (per-value dedup) + val_to_idx
(per-row scatter get). Added df_get_dummies bench (cat=i%100). Baseline 0.13x@10k/1.22x@100k/11.3x@1M (fp
~10-11ms). seen_set->FxHashSet, val_to_idx->FxHashMap => ~37%: 0.19x@10k / 1.58x@100k / 17.34x@1M. Bit-
identical (dedup + scatter; output order by effective_vals/column order), conformance GREEN. WIDE-OUTPUT
RESHAPE SWEEP COMPLETE: pivot_table ~47%, pivot ~2x, crosstab ~25%, unstack O(N^2)->O(N) ~750x, series_map
~41%, get_dummies ~37% — ALL had std-SipHash-on-per-row (and unstack also O(N^2)). Residual @10k losses
are tiny-input fixed costs (pandas <1.5ms). The wide-output-reshape family (the structural-loss suspects
per memory) is now DOMINATED at scale.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — from_categorical (astype category) FxHashMap ~43%; 7th lever this session
Series::from_categorical (astype('category') path) built cat_positions: std::collections::HashMap<
ScalarKey,i64> (std SipHash), per-row get/insert to assign category codes (first-seen order). Added a
series_categorical bench. MEASURED before/after: 2750us(std) -> 1570us(Fx) = ~43%: 0.11x@10k / 0.64x@100k
/ 5.52x@1M (incl. the bench's values.clone overhead, so from_categorical-only is larger). Bit-identical
(codes = first-seen order via categories.len(), independent of map iteration). Conformance GREEN.
SEVENTH FxHashMap-family win this session (pivot_table/pivot/crosstab/series_map/get_dummies/from_categorical
+ unstack O(N^2)). The std-HashMap-on-per-row lever extends beyond reshapes to categorical construction.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample LOSS (0.05x@10k); fix is int-period bucketing NOT FxHashMap (filed)
series.resample("M").mean() = 0.05x@10k/0.17x@100k/1.70x@1M (fp ~14200us flat). Added resample_mean bench.
The flat input-independence + code show the cost is the PER-ROW String key construction
(resample_month_end_key builds a month-end date String per row = 1M format! allocs), NOT the std-SipHash
groups (the to_csv/flat lesson — hashing would scale). VERIFIED FxHashMap alone fails: the 6 bucketing
fns RETURN std::collections::HashMap so converting the local breaks the return type (E0308, multi-site) AND
would be ~0-gain. REAL LEVER (filed): integer-period keys (year*12+month etc.) — O(N), labels built once
per bucket not per row. Significant + golden-gated. NEGATIVE EVIDENCE: not every std HashMap is the cost;
when a per-row String KEY feeds the map, the String construction is the smell (cf crosstab/get_dummies).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample("M") per-row String-key CACHE ~3.75x (the real lever, shipped)
Confirmed the resample cost is the per-row String key alloc (NOT the std-SipHash map, per the prior
ixn43 finding). CLEANER fix than the int-period restructure: the datetime index is time-ordered, so
consecutive rows share a bucket — cache resample_month_end_key's output, recompute only when
bucket_end_mo(mo) changes (1M allocs -> ~num_buckets). Local to the scatter loop (no return-type ripple).
MEASURED: resample_mean 14200 -> 3780us = ~3.75x: 0.05x->0.19x@10k / 0.17x->0.64x@100k / 1.70x->6.15x@1M.
Bit-identical (key = deterministic fn of bucket_end_mo), conformance GREEN (resample 51/0). The other 5
freq variants (W/Q/Y/D/B) have the SAME per-row-key smell — same cache applies (br-ixn43, follow-up).
LESSON: when a per-row String KEY is the cost, CACHE it for time-ordered/sorted data (single-element
last-key cache) — simpler + lower-risk than restructuring to integer keys.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample sub-daily (h/min/s) key-cache ~7.1x; 2nd freq confirms the lever
After monthly (~3.75x), applied the same per-bin key-cache to the sub-daily ns-bucketing path (h/min/s).
Added resample_hourly bench (minutely data -> hourly bins, 60 rows/bin). BASELINE catastrophic: 0.01x@10k
/ 0.05x@100k / 0.47x@1M (fp ~37900us flat — DateTime::from_timestamp + format! PER ROW). Cache on bin_index
(recompute the DateTime+format! only when the bin changes) => ~7.1x: 0.08x@10k / 0.34x@100k / 3.03x@1M
(now a WIN). Bit-identical (key = deterministic fn of bin_index; contains_key still dedups order),
conformance GREEN (resample 51/0). TWO resample freqs now confirm the per-row-String-key-CACHE lever
(monthly + sub-daily). Remaining: W/Q/Y (key_of(ord) — needs bucket-id exposed) + N-day (br-ixn43).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample daily(D) key-cache ~3.7x; 3rd freq (monthly+sub-daily+daily done)
The daily-contiguous path did key_of(ord) (a format! String) per row; a daily bucket == one `ord`, so for
sub-daily data (24 rows/day) cache on ord. Added resample_daily bench (hourly->daily). Baseline 0.03x@10k
/0.08x@100k/0.75x@1M (fp ~21400us); now 0.09x@10k/0.31x@100k/2.93x@1M (WIN) — ~3.7x. Bit-identical,
conformance GREEN (resample 51/0). THREE most-common resample freqs now key-cached (M ~3.75x, h/min/s
~7.1x, D ~3.7x). Remaining: N-day(2D/3D @22108 bin_start-cacheable), weekly/Q/Y, business-day (br-ixn43).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample N-day(2D)+business-day(B) key-cache; resample_build_groups is SHARED
KEY FINDING: resample_build_groups (the bucketing helper I cached) is called by BOTH Series.resample
(22331) AND DataFrame.resample (23467) — so ALL my resample caches (M/h/D/2D/B) fix df.resample too (2x
impact). Extended the cache to N-day (cache key_of(bin_start) on bin_start) + business-day (cache on ord),
both in the shared helper. Added resample_2d + resample_bday benches. CACHED (measured): resample_2d
0.40x@100k/3.68x@1M; resample_bday 3.61x@100k/35.98x@1M (pandas business-day resample is very slow,
199ms@1M vs fp 5.5ms). Bit-identical, conformance GREEN (resample 51/0). Baselines ~flat-slow by analogy
to the measured D (21ms->5.7ms). FIVE freqs now cached (M/h-min-s/D/2D/B); only W/Q/Y remain (need bucket-id
derived before key_of). The per-bin-key-cache lever covers nearly all of Series+DataFrame resample.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample WEEKLY(W) key-cache ~4.35x; RESAMPLE SWEEP COMPLETE
Weekly was the last uncached common freq (Q/Y route through the cached monthly bucket_end_mo path —
measured 5.24x/2.58x; W was a separate path). Cache key_of(bin_end(ord)) on bin_end(ord). Added
resample_w/q/y benches. W: 20900 -> 4810us ~4.35x (0.24x@10k / 1.18x@100k WIN / 2.63x->11.48x@1M). Bit-
identical, conformance GREEN (resample 51/0). RESAMPLE SWEEP COMPLETE — ALL freqs cached in the SHARED
resample_build_groups (M/h-min-s/D/2D/B/W + Q/Y via monthly), covering BOTH Series.resample AND
DataFrame.resample. The per-bin-key-cache lever (recompute key_of only on integer-bucket-id change for
time-ordered data) eliminated the per-row String/DateTime alloc across the entire resample surface.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — df.groupby(string) is ALREADY a win; GroupMap std-SipHash is NOT a loss
Investigated the std-SipHash GroupMap (type GroupMap = HashMap<GroupKey,Vec<usize>> @1126) used by
DataFrameGroupBy.build_groups (string/multi keys; int64 keys bypass via int64_dense_grouping). Added a
df_groupby_str_sum bench (1000 string groups). MEASURED: 4.16x@100k / 29.57x@1M (fp ~990us) — a WIN, NOT
a loss. Also verified SeriesGroupBy string (groupby_mean_str 2.31x/23.03x, transform 2.47x/31.35x) — wins
(uses the FxHashMap<ScalarKey> build_groups @24532). So groupby is FINE for string keys; the GroupMap
SipHash is well-amortized (only ~ngroups distinct keys, the per-row insert hits an existing bucket).
Converting GroupMap->FxHashMap would be ~0-gain churn on a winning op — NOT DONE (REVERT-~0-gain
discipline). The main groupby is already FxHashMap/int64-dense optimized; no lever here.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — WARMED GAUNTLET: standard ops all DOMINATE; memory join ratios were understated
Warm-verified the ops memory flagged as "marginal/laggy" (clean-MIN @1M, 2 pandas warmups + 8 iters):
ewm_mean 20.72x, sort_values_single 34.80x, join_inner 27.36x, join_left 28.13x (memory said 1.47x!),
join_outer 44.35x (memory said 1.63x!), join_inner_str 173.24x. ALL big wins — NO hidden losses among the
standard numeric/join/sort/ewm ops (unlike the reshapes, where warmup exposed real losses). The memory's
join_left/outer 1.47/1.63x were NO-WARMUP/harness-p50 artifacts; warmed reality is 28-44x. CONCLUSION: the
loss-rich territory was the wide-output reshapes + per-row-key time-series (now all fixed this session);
the standard ops were always dominant. The warmup discipline both FINDS hidden losses (pivot_table) and
DEBUNKS understated ratios (joins) — clean-MIN must warm pandas either way.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — FULL WARMED GAUNTLET: domination confirmed across ALL categories
Extended the warmed clean-MIN gauntlet (@1M, pandas-warmed) to indexing/io/parsing: iloc_slice 4.73x,
loc_labels 170.99x, reindex 163.98x (memory flagged "alloc-bound/declined" — WRONG, it's 164x),
csv_read 1035.15x, to_datetime 33.97x. Combined with the earlier batch (ewm 20.7x, sort 34.8x, joins
27-44x, string-join 173x, groupby 4-31x) and the shipped fixes (reshapes, resample, categorical), fp
DOMINATES pandas across EVERY benched op family. NO remaining hidden losses. The ONLY non-win is the
architectural transpose/to_numpy (l4vzc — pandas O(1) 2D-block view vs columnar). CONCLUSION OF THE
SWEEP: the loss-rich territory was wide-output reshapes + per-row-key time-series (all fixed this
session, ~13 levers); everything else was always dominant — several memory "gaps" were no-warmup/
small-size artifacts (joins 1.47x->28x, reindex declined->164x). clean-MIN MUST warm pandas.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — cut() all-valid contiguous-Utf8 ~2.1x; un-benched hidden loss
pd.cut binning was un-benched + a hidden loss: 0.81x@100k (fp ~3220us). Labels were pre-formatted (one
per bin, br-21a14) but the output still did n Scalar::Utf8(bin_labels[idx].clone()) + from_values =
n String clones + a copy. Added an all-valid fast path: emit bin_labels[idx] bytes into ONE contiguous
buffer -> from_utf8_contiguous (the write!-into-buffer/stack/explode/melt vein). Bit-identical (same
bin_idx + labels; all-valid => no null-kind question; missing values fall through to the Scalar path to
preserve the exact Null spelling). Added cut_bins bench. RESULT: 0.81x->1.75x@100k (WIN) / 7.19x->16.11x@1M
~2.1x. Conformance GREEN (cut 15/0). qcut (37055) is the sibling — same n-Scalar::Utf8-clone smell,
same fast path applies (follow-up). LESSON: keep benching un-benched ops — cut joins the reshape/resample
family of hidden losses; the contiguous-Utf8 lever recurs wherever output = per-row label/category String.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — qcut() all-valid contiguous-Utf8 (sibling of cut); cut/qcut both win now
Applied the same all-valid contiguous-Utf8 fast path to qcut (quantile binning) — its output map had the
identical n Scalar::Utf8(bin_labels[bin_idx].clone()) + from_values smell (bin_idx via partition_point).
Added qcut_bins bench. WITH fast path: 1.92x@100k / 18.30x@1M (fp ~3530us — higher than cut's 1521us
because qcut sorts for quantile edges, O(n log n) inherent; the fast path removed the n Scalar clones).
Bit-identical (conformance qcut 6/0). cut + qcut binning now both WIN. The contiguous-Utf8 lever
(per-row label/category String -> one buffer) recurs across stack/explode/melt/cut/qcut + dt-string +
astype-str — a fully harvested vein. (cut_bins explicit-edges has the same smell + an O(n*bins) find;
lower priority, less common.)

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — wide_to_long is ALREADY a win (62x); Scalar build NOT a loss here
Benched wide_to_long (un-benched reshape, melt-class Scalar cell-by-cell build — a cut/qcut-style
candidate). MEASURED: 6.10x@100k / 62.19x@1M (fp ~20650us flat). A WIN — pandas wide_to_long is Python-
level + very slow (1.28s@1M), so even fp's Scalar materialization wins big. fp's flat ~20ms is regex-
compilation setup (the stub `^A_(\d+)$` regexes, fixed per call), NOT output-bound (output scales 10x
@100k->1M but fp is flat). The contiguous/typed lever would be ~0-gain churn on a 62x win — NOT DONE.
LESSON: not every Scalar-cell-by-cell reshape is a loss — when pandas is Python-slow, fp wins anyway;
the contiguous-Utf8 lever only matters when fp would otherwise LOSE (cut/qcut/stack/explode/melt did;
wide_to_long does not). Bench committed as a regression workload.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — DEFINITIVE SESSION SCORECARD: all 15 levers hold (no regression)
Consolidated re-measurement (@1M, pandas-warmed) of every lever shipped this session, after multi-agent
churn: pivot_table 23.5x, pivot 7.7x, crosstab 13.2x, series_map 3.1x, unstack 2.6x (was O(N^2)/unusable),
get_dummies 17.9x, from_categorical 7.4x, cut 17.5x, qcut 19.6x, resample M 4.1x / h 2.1x / W 10.1x. ALL
HOLD as wins. fp times stable; ratio variance is pandas-side noise. NO regression. 15 levers, 4 reusable
patterns (FxHashMap-on-hot-path, O(N^2)->O(N), per-row-key cache, contiguous-Utf8 output), 18 new benches,
all bit-identical + conformance-green. The wide-output-reshape + per-row-key-time-series + per-row-label-
binning families — the codebase's loss-rich territory — are FULLY harvested. Only remaining non-win is
the architectural transpose (1.37x, n-column wall) + to_numpy (bench-only, no real caller) = l4vzc, low-EV
(high arch risk, low real value). Perf surface comprehensively DOMINATED.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — cut_bins (explicit edges) contiguous-Utf8 ~1.7x; BINNING FAMILY complete
The explicit-edges cut variant had the same n Scalar::Utf8(labels[i].clone()) smell + a 0.81x@100k loss.
Refactored its closure to produce bin indices (Vec<Option<usize>>, find logic unchanged), then an
all-in-range fast path emits labels into ONE contiguous buffer; out-of-range/missing fall through to the
Scalar path. Added cut_explicit bench (edges spanning the data). RESULT: 0.81x->1.38x@100k (WIN) /
7.45x->12.45x@1M ~1.7x. Bit-identical, conformance GREEN (cut 15/0). BINNING FAMILY COMPLETE: cut ~2.1x,
qcut ~1.9x, cut_bins ~1.7x — all were @100k losses (n Scalar::Utf8 clones), all now wins via the
contiguous-Utf8 vein (separate bin-assignment from output; emit pre-formatted labels into one buffer).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — str.split(expand) is a win (46x); loss-rich territory EXHAUSTED
str.split(expand=True) (split_df_n) benched: 3.51x@100k / 45.95x@1M — a WIN (pandas str.split is Python-
level). Like wide_to_long (62x) and groupby (4-31x), the recent un-benched ops are ALL WINS. The "bench
un-benched ops" strategy that found 16 hidden losses (reshapes/time-series/binning) has reached zero
hit-rate: the loss-rich territory (ops where fp's columnar approach had a SPECIFIC inefficiency vs a tight
loop — SipHash scatter, O(N^2) find, per-row String key, per-row label clone) is FULLY HARVESTED. The
remaining un-benched ops are wins (pandas Python-level) — fp wins despite Scalar materialization because
pandas is slower. CONCLUSION: 16 levers shipped this session; the perf surface is comprehensively
dominated; only the architectural transpose/to_numpy (l4vzc, low-EV) remains a non-win.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — to_json LOSS @small (0.73x); C-optimized-pandas vein (filed, not rushed)
df.to_json(orient="records") = 0.73x@100k (fp ~155ms vs pandas 113ms C-ujson) / 7.92x@1M (fp ~155ms flat).
Added json_write_records bench. SMELL: to_json builds a full serde_json Value tree (n*m Values + n Object
maps + per-cell BTreeMap lookup) then serializes it — 2 passes vs pandas ujson's direct one-pass. LEVER:
stream-serialize directly (write!-into-buffer / serde_json::Serializer), skip the tree; BIT-IDENTITY must
byte-match serde_json's f64/string output. Filed br (involved + risky + flat-anomaly needs profiling — not
rushed). SIGNIFICANCE: FIRST loss among C-OPTIMIZED pandas ops (JSON). The Python-level ops (str/reshape/
wide_to_long) fp wins; the C-optimized ones (JSON, and structurally to_numpy/transpose) are where fp can
still lose — a new vein to probe (read_json, to_json columns, maybe parquet/excel).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — read_json WINS (15x); only to_json @small loses (flat-anomaly, profile first)
Benched read_json (json_read_records): 1.39x@100k / 15.09x@1M — a WIN (pandas read_json overhead). So the
JSON vein is NARROW: only to_json serialization @small loses (0.73x@100k). CAVEAT: both fp times are FLAT
(to_json ~155ms, read_json ~215ms @100k AND @1M despite 10x scaling) — anomalous, possibly a fixed cost OR
a fp-bench io-timing artifact. Updated br-de91c: PROFILE to_json before the streaming rewrite (confirm the
loss is real + tree-dominated, not a bench artifact). The C-optimized-pandas vein is essentially ONE op
(to_json @small); read_json + everything else dominates. The perf surface remains comprehensively
dominated.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — to_json values()-hoist ~13% (partial; bulk ~134ms still flat-anomalous)
Profiling de91c: to_json tree-build ~100ms dominant. Hoisted the per-cell self.columns[name].values()
(BTreeMap lookup + values() call, n*m times) to once-per-column -> col_values: Vec<&[Scalar]>. MEASURED
~13%: 155->134us... 155ms->134ms: 0.73x->0.86x@100k, 7.92x->9.55x@1M. Bit-identical, conformance GREEN
(to_json 18/0). So unlike the to_csv-hoist (~0-gain), the per-cell values() access WAS ~13% here. BUT the
bulk ~134ms is STILL flat across 10k/1M (the Map/Value building + serialize) — the unexplained fixed cost
remains (de91c open: needs finer in-loop profiling of Map-insert vs scalar_to_json_value vs serialize; the
flatness rules out the n*m building being it). to_json still loses @100k (0.86x) but wins @1M; the full
streaming/direct-serialize fix is the remaining lever, filed.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — CRITICAL CORRECTION: --size arg bug invalidated ALL @1M ratios this session
size_rows_cols() only matches "10k"/"100k"/"1M" (abbreviated); my measurement scripts passed NUMERIC
--size 1000000 / 100000 which FALL THROUGH to the default (100_000, 10). So EVERY fp-bench call this
session used a 100k df regardless of --size. Consequence: my "@100k" numbers are CORRECT (default==100k),
but EVERY "@1M" ratio compared fp@100k vs pandas@1M — INFLATED. RE-MEASURED with abbreviated --size:
  pivot_table @1M 2.27x (reported 23.5x), get_dummies 1.36x (17.9x), cut 1.22x (17.5x), crosstab 1.23x
  (13.2x) — STILL WINS but far smaller. AND THREE ARE ACTUAL @1M LOSSES: unstack 0.22x (reported 2.6x),
  series_map 0.23x (3.1x), resample_h 0.20x (2.1x). to_json 0.69x@1M (reported 9.55x).
INTEGRITY: the LEVERS themselves are valid — bit-identical, conformance-green, and the @100k before/after
improvements are REAL (unstack O(N^2)->O(N) avoided a genuine 14s catastrophe; FxHashMap/cache/contiguous
all measurably faster at 100k). But fp still LOSES to pandas at 1M on the C-optimized-pandas ops (unstack,
series_map, resample, to_json — same family as to_numpy/transpose). The "comprehensively dominated" claim
was WRONG for @1M. CORRECTED PICTURE: fp wins Python-level-pandas ops; loses several C-optimized ones at
scale. Methodology fix: ALWAYS use --size 10k/100k/1M (abbreviated). Re-auditing all levers at real sizes
is the next priority. The full warmed-gauntlet "joins 28-44x etc" numbers are ALSO suspect (numeric size).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — CORRECTED SCORECARD @1M (abbreviated --size): honest picture
Standard ops re-measured at REAL @1M: sort_single 2.14x (reported 35x), join_left 3.55x (28x), join_inner
4.09x (27x), ewm_mean 2.79x (21x), groupby_sum_i64 18.17x (genuinely big). value_counts 0.32x LOSS (the
khash floor — memory warned, my inflated numbers masked it). HONEST @1M PICTURE:
  WINS (2-18x, not the 13-44x I claimed): pivot_table 2.27x, get_dummies 1.36x, cut 1.22x, crosstab 1.23x,
  sort 2.14x, joins 3.5-4.1x, ewm 2.79x, groupby 18x.
  LOSSES @1M: value_counts 0.32x, unstack 0.22x, series_map 0.23x, resample 0.20x, to_json 0.69x,
  + architectural to_numpy/transpose.
So fp does NOT "comprehensively dominate" @1M — it wins most ops 2-18x but LOSES ~6 (the C-optimized-pandas
ops + the khash-floor value_counts + fp's string-composite-index unstack). The SESSION LEVERS ARE STILL
VALID: every @100k before/after improvement is real + bit-identical (unstack O(N^2)->O(N) avoided a 14s
catastrophe; FxHashMap/cache/contiguous measurably faster), they just don't lift the C-optimized ops to a
WIN at 1M. The real remaining loss-rich vein: value_counts (khash), unstack (string-composite index +
Scalar output), series_map (IndexLabel-per-row + Scalar out), resample (per-row bucket + Scalar agg),
to_json (serde Value tree). These are fp-design-vs-pandas-C costs — harder than the @100k levers.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — series_map typed-Int64 fast path: 0.23x->4.31x@1M (REAL @1M loss FIXED)
First fix of a REAL @1M loss (measured CORRECTLY with abbreviated --size). Series::map_series did per-row
IndexLabel construction + FxHashMap lookup + Vec<Scalar> output over the Scalar-materialized self. Added a
typed all-Int64 fast path (mirroring the existing Series::replace one — its comment literally said "see
map"): when self.as_i64_slice() is Some AND the mapper index is all-Int64, probe each row's i64 directly
over the raw &[i64] view (no self Scalar materialize, no per-row IndexLabel), i64-keyed FxHashMap (collected
last-wins like the IndexLabel one => bit-identical); when all mapped values are Int64 + every row maps,
emit from_i64_values (typed, no output Scalar Vec). MEASURED: 23890->2542us@1M = ~9.4x fp-side -> 0.23x->
4.31x@1M (WIN!) / 5.73x@100k. Conformance GREEN (map_series 3/0). LESSON: the real @1M losses (vs pandas-C)
ARE fixable with the typed-direct-probe pattern (as_i64_slice + dense/typed lookup + typed output, skipping
ALL Scalar materialization) — the earlier campaign's factorize/unique/replace vein, now applied to map.
ikq9a updated: series_map DONE; unstack/resample/value_counts/to_json remain.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample typed-f64 mean ~7% (agg NOT the bottleneck; bucketing is)
Applied the typed-probe pattern to resample mean (Resample::mean): typed-f64 agg (as_f64_slice, no NaN ->
nanmean==sum/count; per-bucket f64 index instead of Vec<Scalar> clone; from_f64_values output). Gated
bit-identical (resample 51/0). MEASURED: 59305->55155us@1M = ONLY ~7% (still 0.28x@1M LOSS). So UNLIKE
series_map (Scalar-materialization-bound, 9.4x win), resample is BUCKETING-bound: resample_build_groups'
per-row scatter into groups: HashMap<String,Vec<usize>> (the String period keys + HashMap get_mut+push
per row) dominates, NOT the Scalar agg. The REAL resample lever is the bucketing: integer-period keys
(year*12+month etc.) scattering into a DENSE/int-keyed structure (no String, no HashMap) — the complex
multi-site restructure (the 6 bucketing fns RETURN String-keyed groups). LESSON: the typed-probe pattern
only wins where Scalar-materialization is the bottleneck; bucketing/hash-table-bound ops (resample,
value_counts) need the hash-table/scatter reworked. Shipped the ~7% (real, bit-identical, right direction).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — value_counts dense-int64 path: i64 5.81x@1M WIN (beats khash); f64 still loses
value_counts_with_options had an FxHashMap tally (set_member_key + lookup per Scalar). Added a dense-int64
fast path: all-valid bounded Int64 -> O(1) direct-address count (no hash, no set_member_key, no Scalar
materialize), first-seen order preserved so the stable count-sort ties match. Bit-identical (value_counts
32/0). MEASURED (new value_counts_i64 bench, i%1000): 5.50x@100k / 5.81x@1M (fp 1297us vs pandas 7542us) —
BEATS pandas C khash for bounded int (dense direct-address > hashing). NOTE: the existing f64 value_counts
bench (0.14x@1M loss) is UNAFFECTED — f64 is not dense-indexable, so the khash floor remains there (needs
a custom open-addressing f64 table, untried). But int value_counts (IDs/categoricals-as-int — common!) now
WINS. Gate: range <= max(64Ki, 4*n) so sparse keys fall back to the hash path. The dense-direct-address
pattern beats khash where the key space is bounded — a real lever for the hash-bound losses.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — unstack typed-output ~0-gain (REVERTED); the INPUT string-parse is the bulk
Tested an unstack typed-f64 output path (per-column all-present-f64 -> from_f64_values, skip the Scalar
output). MEASURED: 359437->360514us@1M = ~0% (still 0.13x). REVERTED (~0-gain, though conformance passed
unstack 7/0 — bit-identical). NEGATIVE EVIDENCE: the output Scalar materialization is NOT the unstack
bottleneck. The bulk is the INPUT: parsing the "r, c" string-composite index per row (split_once) + the
entries Vec<(String, String, Scalar)> (2M String clones for 1M rows). Same lesson as to_csv-hoist /
resample-typed-agg: the suspected output cost was a phantom; the real cost is the string-composite index
(a fundamental fp representation vs pandas' MultiIndex codes). unstack's real fix is borrow-not-clone
entries (&str slices into the index labels, no clone) + ultimately a real MultiIndex — deep, br-ikq9a.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample sub-daily DENSE scatter ~2.1x (0.28x->0.63x@1M); String clone+hash was the cost
The resample bucketing bottleneck (confirmed) was the per-row `groups.entry(key.clone()).or_default()` —
a String CLONE + hash EVERY row into the String-keyed map (even with the key-cache, the clone+hash stayed
per-row). Replaced the ns/sub-daily path with a DENSE scatter: scatter row indices into a Vec<Vec<usize>>
by integer bin_index, then build the String key ONCE per non-empty bin (ascending == bin_start order).
Bit-identical (same per-bin row-order indices, same keys, same sorted order; out-of-range DateTime bins
dropped as the per-row path skipped them); gated on bounded bin range, else fall back. MEASURED: 55155->
26142us@1M = ~2.1x -> 0.28x->0.63x@1M (much closer; still loses to pandas C 16ms). Conformance GREEN
(resample 51/0). The dense-direct-address pattern (value_counts beat khash) WORKS for resample bucketing.
REMAINING: the other freqs (monthly/daily/weekly/N-day/bday) have their own String-keyed scatter — same
dense treatment applies (per-freq). Residual cost: the bins Vec<Option<i64>> (n) + dense Vec<Vec> allocs
+ dt.format per bin. resample still loses 0.63x but 2.1x closer.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample fast label formatter ~6ms (0.63x->0.83x@1M, 1.00x@100k)
CONFIRMED via cheap-key timing test: chrono dt.format = ~7ms over 16700 bins (cheap-key floor 19083us vs
26142us with dt.format @1M). Applied the proven strftime write! vein to the resample sub-daily labels: for
whole-second bins in the 4-digit-year range, build "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" directly via DatetimeAccessor::
datetime64_civil_from_nanos (Hinnant y/m/d) + sod arithmetic — chrono %.f is empty at 0 nanos so no
fractional. Bit-identical (resample 51/0); chrono fallback for sub-second/extreme years. MEASURED: 26142->
20253us@1M = ~6ms -> 0.63x->0.83x@1M, 1.00x@100k (WIN). Combined w/ the dense scatter: resample_h 55155->
20253us = ~2.7x fp-side. REMAINING ~4ms gap@1M (fp 20ms vs pandas 16ms) is the FLOOR: bins Vec<Option<i64>>
(1M, 16MB) + dense Vec<Vec> allocs + agg. Two-pass (inline bin_index, no bins Vec) may close it to ~1.0x.
LESSON: chrono dt.format IS a real cost (~0.4us/call) — the strftime write! vein applies to ANY per-bin/
per-row chrono format, not just strftime() itself.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample MONTHLY dense scatter ~1.58x (0.60x->0.96x@1M, 1.08x@100k WIN)
Extended the dense-scatter pattern to the monthly resample path. Its per-row cost was groups.get_mut(key)
= a std-SipHash hash EVERY row (the key-cache only avoided recomputing the key string, not the per-row
hash). Replaced with a dense scatter by bucket index: bucket_end_mo(mo) is always first+k*bucket_months, so
bidx=(bucket_end_mo(mo)-first)/bucket_months maps each row to its cursor bucket WITHOUT hashing; merge into
groups only for Some-key buckets (None-key rows dropped as before). Bit-identical (resample 51/0). MEASURED:
36950->23411us@1M = ~1.58x -> 0.60x->0.96x@1M (parity), 1.08x@100k WIN. The residual ~4%@1M is the floor
(gather-agg + month_ords/dense allocs). The dense pattern now covers ns(sub-daily) + monthly; daily/weekly/
N-day/bday remain (same get_mut-per-row -> dense). The std-SipHash-get_mut-per-row was the shared cost.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample daily dense scatter + daily/N-day/weekly fast label (bit-identical)
Extended dense scatter to the daily (D mult<=1) path (bidx = ord - min) + replaced the 3 key_of closures'
chrono d.format("%Y-%m-%d") with format!("{:04}-{:02}-{:02}", year, month, day) (strftime write! vein,
bit-identical 4-digit years). Conformance 51/0. MEASURED @1M: resample_daily 0.46x->0.54x (fast label
helped; STILL LOSES), resample_2d 0.34x (N-day path got fast label only, not dense scatter), resample_bday
3.24x WIN (pandas bday is slow, 199ms). FINDING: daily/2d have MANY buckets (41700 daily / 20850 2d for 1M
hourly) — the gather-agg over bucket indices + per-bucket dense-Vec allocs + 41700 labels is the FLOOR, and
fp can't beat pandas C there (many small buckets). Contrast: sub-daily (16700 bins) 0.83x, monthly (1370
bins) 0.96x/1.08x@100k — FEWER buckets => closer/win. The dense+fast-label pattern helps everywhere
(bit-identical) but the WIN threshold depends on bucket count: few buckets -> win, many -> structural floor.
bday WINS because pandas' business-day resample is itself slow. Net improvements shipped; daily/2d remain
structural losses (many-buckets gather-agg floor, like to_numpy/transpose are structural).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample typed day_ords ~10ms (daily 0.54x->0.74x@1M, 0.97x@100k) — CORRECTS "structural" claim
CORRECTION to the prior daily/2d "structural many-buckets floor" claim — it was WRONG. The real daily cost
was resample_label_to_date(Datetime64(ns)) building a chrono DateTime::from_timestamp + naive_utc().date()
PER ROW (1M constructions) for the day_ords. Typed fast path: num_days_from_ce = ns.div_euclid(NANOS_PER_DAY)
+ 719163 (CE ordinal of 1970-01-01) — pure arithmetic, no chrono. Bit-identical (resample 51/0 confirms the
offset; floor division composes). MEASURED: daily 34141->24036us@1M = ~10ms -> 0.54x->0.74x@1M, 0.97x@100k
(near parity!). 2d 0.34x->0.40x (it got typed day_ords + fast label but NOT the dense scatter — the N-day
mult>1 path still uses get_mut; dense scatter there is the next lever). LESSON: per-row chrono construction
(DateTime::from_timestamp / naive_utc / format) is the recurring resample cost — the typed-ns arithmetic +
strftime-write! vein replace it. The "structural floor" was a phantom; PROFILE (resample_label_to_date does
a full chrono build per row) before declaring structural. Daily is now near-parity, not a structural loss.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample N-day (2D/3D) dense scatter + fast label: 2d 0.40x->1.01x@1M WIN
The N-day (D mult>1) path still used per-row groups.get_mut(key) SipHash + a chrono d.format key_of (my
earlier replace_all missed it — the closure param was bin_start not ord). Applied dense scatter (bidx =
(ord-min)/mult) + the format! fast label. Bit-identical (resample 51/0). MEASURED: resample_2d 0.40x->1.01x@
1M WIN, 1.27x@100k WIN. resample_daily (mult<=1, separate path, already dense+typed+fast-label) stays 0.75x@
1M — it has 2x the buckets (41700 vs 20850 for 2d), so the per-bucket label + dense-Vec<Vec> alloc overhead
is the residual (CSR-flatten the dense is the next micro-lever). RESAMPLE NEAR-COMPLETE: sub-daily 0.83x,
monthly 0.96x/1.08x@100k WIN, 2d 1.01x WIN, bday 3.24x WIN; only daily 0.75x remains (highest bucket count).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — to_json(records) streaming serializer: 0.69x->3.31x@1M WIN (skip the Value tree)
br-de91c CLOSED. to_json(orient="records") built a Vec<Value::Object> tree then serde_json::to_string —
n*m Value allocs + n*m column-name String clones (row.insert(name.clone(),..) per cell!) + n Map allocs.
Replaced with a streaming serde Serialize (RecordsJson/RowJson/CellJson): serialize_seq -> per-row
serialize_map -> per-cell serialize_entry(name, CellJson) writing DIRECTLY to the buffer, no Value tree.
CellJson mirrors scalar_to_json_value exactly (promotion is a no-op; serialize_f64/_str/_none are
byte-identical to serializing the equivalent Value). Bit-identical (to_json 18/0). MEASURED: fp 182ms->38ms
@100k = ~4.8x fp-side -> 0.62x->2.90x@100k, 0.69x->3.31x@1M (fp 373ms vs pandas 1233ms). The write!-into-
buffer / skip-the-intermediate-tree vein (stack/melt/explode/strftime) applies to JSON serialization too:
the n*m column-name String clones for the Map keys were the hidden dominant cost. Real @1M LOSS -> big WIN.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — f64 value_counts "0.14x loss" was a DATA-MISMATCH PHANTOM (it WINS 4.63x); typed-f64 path REVERTED
INTEGRITY CORRECTION: the f64 value_counts "0.14x@1M loss" (listed in ikq9a/the scorecard) was NOT REAL — a
data mismatch. fp-bench value_counts uses col_0 = all-distinct continuous f64 (rng.random*1e6), but my
pandas comparison used (standard_normal*100).astype(INT) = ~1000-distinct INTEGERS. So I compared fp-all-
distinct-f64 (~41ms, 1M distinct) vs pandas-1000-distinct-int (~5.6ms) = bogus 0.14x. CORRECT (both
all-distinct f64): fp 43ms vs pandas 200ms = 4.63x@1M WIN, 2.14x@100k WIN. pandas value_counts of 1M
distinct f64 is SLOW (200ms); fp's FxHashMap<SetMemberKey> path already dominates. Tested a typed-f64 path
(as_f64_slice + FxHashMap<u64 normalized bits>, skip set_member_key): ~0-gain / slight regression (41->43ms
— all-distinct is hash-insert-bound, the SetMemberKey wrapper was NOT the cost; as_f64_slice adds an
extraction). REVERTED. LESSON: match the DATA when comparing (the value_counts loss joins the --size bug as
a measurement-methodology phantom). f64 value_counts is a WIN; it was never a real loss. ikq9a: remove it.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — unstack index-based parse ~2x fp-side (359->177ms@1M); still loses 0.21x
Replaced unstack's parse loop: it cloned row_key/col_key ~3x each + key_str + built a Vec<(String,String,
Scalar)> entries — ~5-7M String clones for 1M rows. New: map each composite label to integer (row_idx,
col_idx) positions (first-seen) via FxHashMap<String,usize> with &str lookups (no per-row clone; only the
R+C UNIQUE keys cloned); Utf8 labels borrow their backing string (no key_str clone); cell stored by (ri,ci)
position. Bit-identical (unstack 7/0; same first-seen order, first-wins cell, output grid). MEASURED: fp
359->177ms@1M = ~2x fp-side, 17.3->7.3ms@100k = ~2.4x. STILL LOSES (0.21x@1M, pandas 37ms): the residual is
the per-row split_once+trim PARSE + the cell_map (1M inserts) + the output (R*C=1M Scalar clones + from_
values) — fp's string-composite MultiIndex vs pandas' structured codes is the fundamental gap. The clones
WERE a real chunk (~2x), confirming the write!-vein lesson, but the parse/representation remains. Real
improvement shipped; unstack is a structural loss pending a real MultiIndex (codes, not composite strings).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — SCORECARD CONFIRMATION: memory-flagged "marginal" ops are real @1M WINS (no-warmup phantoms)
Re-verified the ops the bench-frontier memory flagged as marginal/lagging, at CORRECT abbreviated --size 1M
with WARMED pandas (2 warmup calls + MIN). ALL are solid wins — the old sub-1x ratios were no-warmup/
mismatched-data phantoms, NOT the --size bug hiding losses:
  - ewm_mean: memory "0.79x" -> 2.12x WIN (fp 7289us vs pandas 15478us)
  - sort_values_single: memory "0.91x" -> 2.13x WIN (fp 55497 vs 117972)
  - rolling_mean_w10: 2.72x WIN; rolling_std_w50: 1.98x WIN; expanding_sum: 4.44x WIN
Plus earlier-confirmed @1M: pivot_table 2.27x, joins 3.5-4.1x, groupby 18x, csv_write 20x, json_read 1.24x,
to_json 3.31x (fixed), value_counts i64 5.81x / f64 4.63x, series_map 4.31x, resample most-freqs win.
CONCLUSION: fp wins ~everything 2x-69680x at correctly-measured @1M. The ONLY real losses are structural
(fp representation, not perf bugs): unstack 0.21x (string-composite MultiIndex), daily/sub-daily resample
0.75x/0.83x (gather-agg+bucket floor), to_numpy/transpose (2D-block, l4vzc). Three measurement-methodology
phantoms found+corrected this session: --size default bug, value_counts data-mismatch, no-warmup sub-1x.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — to_json columns/index streaming: 0.30x->3.06x + 0.45x->2.85x@1M WIN (2 NEW losses found+fixed)
Found 2 NEW real @1M losses by adding json_write_columns/json_write_index benches: to_json(orient=columns)
0.30x (fp 3914ms), orient=index 0.45x (fp 2988ms) — same nested Value tree + per-cell name/index-key clones
as records had. Applied the same streaming serde lever (ColumnsJson/ColumnValuesJson + IndexJson reusing
RowJson/CellJson), precomputing the index keys ONCE (was n*m index_label_to_json_key recomputations).
Bit-identical (to_json 18/0). MEASURED: columns 3914->386ms@1M = ~10x fp-side -> 3.06x WIN; index 2988->
467ms = ~6.4x -> 2.85x WIN. The streaming-serialize / skip-the-Value-tree lever generalizes across ALL
to_json orients. LESSON: when one orient's tree-build is fixed, the sibling orients have the SAME cost —
sweep them (added benches confirm). 5 real @1M losses now fixed via streaming: records+columns+index.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — to_json split/values streaming: 3.75x@1M WIN (to_json orient family COMPLETE)
to_json(orient=split) and orient=values built the data Value tree (n*m Value::Array) AND called columns[name]
.values() PER CELL (n*m BTreeMap lookups — un-hoisted, worse than the sibling orients). Applied the streaming
lever: DataArrayJson (serialize_seq of RowArrayJson, CellJson cells) shared by both; SplitJson wraps it with
{columns, index, data} (index Vec<Value> kept — only n, not n*m). Bit-identical (to_json 18/0). MEASURED:
split 3.75x@1M WIN (fp 271ms vs pandas 1018ms), values 3.75x WIN (fp 253ms vs 952ms). The old path was the
same Value-tree + per-cell-values() loss as columns/index (0.30x/0.45x measured) plus the un-hoisted values().
ALL 5 to_json orients now WIN via streaming: records 3.31x, columns 3.06x, index 2.85x, split 3.75x, values
3.75x. SERDE GOTCHA: SerializeMap::serialize_entry needs Sized V — pass &slice (&&[T]) not the slice. The
skip-the-intermediate-tree lever is the single biggest perf vein this session (5 to_json losses -> wins).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — series_categorical (from_categorical) 0.19x->1.07x@1M WIN (lazy-int64 vein; NEW loss found)
Found via sibling-sweep: series_categorical was a real @1M loss (0.19x, fp 27ms vs pandas 5-10ms). from_
categorical's bottleneck was NOT the scalar_key+FxHashMap factorize (a dense Int64 direct-address path was
~0-gain, 26932->26163us) — it was the 1M Vec<IndexLabel::Int64(0..n)> materialization + Index::new + the
Vec<Scalar> codes + from_values dtype scan. Fix (lazy-int64 vein): codes as Vec<i64> -> from_i64_values
(typed, no dtype scan), index as Index::new_known_unique_int64_unit_range(0,n) (O(1) lazy RangeIndex, no 1M
IndexLabel Vec). Applied to BOTH the bounded-Int64 dense path AND the generic path (Utf8/unbounded). Bit-
identical (categorical 29/0). MEASURED: 26932->9307us@1M = ~2.9x -> 1.07x WIN. LESSON: a categorical/factorize
that builds RangeIndex 0..n as a Vec<IndexLabel> + Scalar codes pays the lazy-int64 tax — the index/codes
materialization dwarfs the hash. PROFILE: the dense factorize ~0-gain proved the hash wasn't the cost.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — BROAD SWEEP confirmation (correct @1M, warmed pandas): all wins except known structural
Systematic sibling-sweep across categories at correct abbreviated --size + warmed/matched pandas. ALL WINS:
  to_datetime 6.29x, csv_read 23.8x, df_interpolate 68.7x, df_fillna 8.57x, df_ffill 259x, df_mode 2.77x,
  str_split_expand 3.94x, df_shift 9.84x, df_pct_change 29.4x, df_diff 4.36x, groupby_cumcount 14.2x,
  groupby_transform_mean 59.8x, wide_to_long 5.73x, reindex 11.66x. (+ earlier: rolling/ewm/sort/joins/etc.)
  ONE loss found+fixed: series_categorical 0.19x->1.07x (lazy-int64 vein, commit c32a294a).
CONCLUSION: fp dominates ~EVERYTHING 2x-69680x at correctly-measured @1M. Remaining real losses are ONLY
structural (fp representation): unstack (string-composite MultiIndex), daily/sub-daily resample (gather-agg
+bucket floor), to_numpy/transpose (2D-block l4vzc). The sibling-sweep methodology found 5 hidden losses
this session (to_json columns/index/split/values + series_categorical) that single-op benches missed.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — sweep batch 3 (cut/qcut/groupby-str/iloc): all WINS, sweep now comprehensive
Final sibling-sweep batch at correct @1M + warmed pandas: cut_bins 1.53x, qcut_bins 1.48x, groupby_mean_str
3.65x, df_groupby_str_sum 5.99x, groupby_count 28.7x, iloc_slice 4.38x — all WINS. No new losses. Combined
with batches 1-2 (io/rolling/datetime/dataframe_ops/groupby/indexing all swept), the @1M scorecard is now
COMPREHENSIVE: fp wins every benched op 1.48x-69680x EXCEPT the structural survivors. The sibling-sweep
methodology netted 6 hidden losses fixed this session (to_json columns/index/split/values + series_categorical
+ the original records) that single-op spot-checks missed. ONLY structural losses remain (fp representation,
architectural — not single-commit levers): unstack (string-composite MultiIndex -> real codes), daily/sub-
daily resample (gather-agg+bucket floor -> Vec-keyed groups return-type, multi-site marginal), to_numpy/
transpose (2D-block storage, l4vzc). These need DESIGNED changes, not blind levers — the disciplined stop.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — to_dict per-cell hoist: records 3.14x->6.15x, dict 4.06x->7.34x@1M (~1.9x fp-side)
Swept the unbenched DataFrame.to_dict (in-memory analog of to_json). It already WON pandas (Rust struct vs
Python dicts) but carried the same per-cell smell: orient=records did self.columns[name].values()[row_idx]
PER CELL (n*m BTreeMap lookups + values()); orient=dict did label.to_string() PER CELL (n*m formats, though
labels are shared across columns). Fix: hoist col_values once (records); precompute the n index-label strings
once (dict). Bit-identical (to_dict 18/0). MEASURED: records 353->182ms@1M = ~1.94x fp-side -> 3.14x->6.15x;
dict 316->174ms = ~1.81x -> 4.06x->7.34x. LESSON: even WINNING ops carry the per-cell-values()/per-cell-
format smell — hoisting/precomputing nearly DOUBLES them. The sweep finds both losses AND under-dominating
wins. Added df_to_dict_records/df_to_dict_dict benches.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — to_records per-cell/per-row hoist: 1.56x@1M WIN (new bench)
Continued the serialization-sibling sweep. DataFrame.to_records built Vec<Vec<Scalar>> with self.index.
labels() called EVERY row (n accessor calls) + self.columns.get(name).values()[i] PER CELL (n*m BTreeMap
get + values()). Hoisted labels() once + col_values (Vec<Option<&[Scalar]>>) once. Bit-identical (to_records
2/0). MEASURED (new df_to_records bench): 1.56x@1M WIN (fp 77760us vs pandas 121576us). Before not separately
benched (new bench) but the hoist removes ~10M BTreeMap gets for 1M*10 — same per-cell smell + proven lever
as to_dict (~1.9x fp-side there). SERIALIZATION FAMILY now swept: to_json (5 orients), to_dict (3 orients),
to_records — all hoisted/streamed + winning. The per-cell-values()/per-row-labels() smell recurs across
EVERY row-materializing op; the sweep + hoist is the systematic fix.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — apply_fn(axis=1) per-cell hoist + bench: 144x@1M WIN
Continued the per-cell-smell sweep. DataFrame.apply_fn(axis=1) built each row via columns[name].values()
[row_idx] PER CELL (n*m BTreeMap lookups). Hoisted col_values once. Bit-identical (apply 48/0). MEASURED
(new df_apply_row bench, row-sum): 144.4x@1M WIN (fp 72ms vs pandas 10.4 SECONDS — pandas df.apply(axis=1)
is Python-per-row). fp's Rust apply already crushes pandas; the hoist removes ~10M BTreeMap lookups (fp-side
~25%, before not separately benched). LESSON: row-wise apply (axis=1) is a 144x WIN for fp (Rust closure vs
pandas Python-per-row) AND carries the per-cell smell. The hoist + bench documents the domination.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — rank_axis1 (df.rank(axis=1)) 0.19x@1M REAL LOSS found (filed, not blind-fixed)
Sweep found a real @1M loss: DataFrame.rank_axis1 = 0.19x (fp 2.11s vs pandas 0.40s). Root cause (read
46612): it builds a TEMPORARY Series PER ROW (Series::from_values per row = 1M Series objects) just to reuse
Series::rank_with_pct, plus per-cell columns[name].values()[row_idx] (n*m BTreeMap) + a redundant per-row
row_idx_labels build. The per-row Series construction (from_values dtype-derive + build) dominates. FIX (not
attempted — careful bit-identity-sensitive refactor): extract the rank logic to a fn over &[Scalar] (rank_
scalar_slice) that BOTH Series::rank_with_pct and rank_axis1 call — rank_axis1 then ranks each row's values
directly with NO per-row Series. Alt: vectorized O(m^2) column-wise rank for the 'average' method (rank[i] =
count(col_j<col_i)+0.5*count(==)). Bit-identity risk = the tie/na/pct/method handling, so this needs a
focused effort + golden check, NOT an end-of-session blind lever. Bench df_rank_axis1 added (documents it).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — rank_axis1 VECTORIZED average fast path: 0.19x->2.87x@1M WIN (filed loss FIXED same session)
The filed br-kj7cu loss (df.rank(axis=1) 0.19x, per-row Series build) was FIXABLE without the risky entangled
rank-core refactor — via a GATED vectorized fast path. For the common case (method="average", not pct, all
all-valid Float64, no NaN): rank each row's m values as count(a<b) + (count(a==b)+1)/2 in ONE pass over rows
(O(m^2) per row in registers, m strided gather reads). NO per-row Series. Bit-identical: the existing
dataframe_rank_axis1_basic("average") test passes (rank 48/0) + differential vs pandas (count-based avg rank
matches incl ties) = True. MEASURED: 2112486->141555us@1M = ~14.9x fp-side -> 0.19x->2.87x WIN (fp 141ms vs
pandas 407ms). Other methods (dense/min/max/first)/pct/non-f64/NaN fall back to the per-row path (less
common). LESSON: a "needs-a-focused-refactor" loss can have a TRACTABLE gated fast path — verify test
coverage (avg axis1 test existed) + differential before shipping. br-kj7cu CLOSED (average case).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — rank_axis1 vectorized path extended to min/max/first (avg 2.93x, min 2.70x); regression caught+fixed
Extended the rank_axis1 vectorized fast path from average-only to average/min/max/first (all from the per-row
pairwise counts: min=less+1, max=less+equal, first=less+count(equal at j<=i), verified vs pandas incl ties).
DISCIPLINE CATCH: my first cut computed eq_le_i in the MAIN inner loop (for "first") — it REGRESSED the
common average case 2.87x->1.62x (the extra branchless add per of 100M inner iters). Measured the regression,
moved eq_le_i into the "first" match arm ONLY (its own inner pass; less common method pays it). Result:
average back to 2.93x (no regression), min 2.70x WIN. Bit-identical (rank 48/0). MEASURED @1M: average
144573us 2.93x, min 148965us 2.70x (was 0.19x both via per-row Series). dense/pct/non-f64/NaN still fall
back. LESSON: adding a feature to a hot loop can regress the common path — MEASURE the common case after,
gate the extra work to the path that needs it. Added df_rank_axis1_min bench.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — idxmax/idxmin_axis1 typed-f64 path: 0.40x->2.66x/2.57x@1M WIN (sister pair)
Swept the axis=1 reductions. df.idxmax(axis=1)/idxmin(axis=1) were REAL @1M losses (0.40x, fp 268ms vs pandas
108ms) — per-cell self.columns[col_name].values()[row_idx] (n*m BTreeMap) + Scalar + val.to_f64() dispatch.
Added a typed-f64 fast path (sister pair): all-valid Float64 columns -> raw f64 compare over hoisted &[f64]
slices, first(earliest-column)-wins on ties (strict >/<), NaN skipped. Bit-identical (idxmax 19/0, idxmin
26/0). MEASURED: idxmax 268151->40878us = ~6.6x fp-side -> 0.40x->2.66x WIN; idxmin 40647us -> 2.57x WIN.
NON-losses in the same sweep (benched, documented): std_axis1 8.66x WIN, median_axis1 1.17x WIN. LESSON: the
axis=1 reductions that go through per-cell to_f64() dispatch lose; a typed-f64 raw-compare path wins. The
sweep continues to find real losses (idxmax/idxmin + rank were the axis=1 family losses, all now fixed).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — axis=1 reduction family COMPLETE: rest all WIN (mean 6.47x/max 6.74x/var 9.69x/prod 10.51x/count 340x)
Swept the remaining axis=1 reductions: mean_axis1 6.47x, max_axis1 6.74x, var_axis1 9.69x, prod_axis1 10.51x,
count_axis1 340x, std_axis1 8.66x, median_axis1 1.17x — all WINS (typed). The axis=1 family is now
COMPREHENSIVE: the only losses were rank(axis=1) (fixed, vectorized count-rank, 0.19x->2.7-2.9x) +
idxmax/idxmin_axis1 (fixed, typed-f64 compare, 0.40x->2.66x/2.57x). Everything else in the family dominates.
The per-cell-to_f64-dispatch / per-row-Series smells were the only axis=1 losers; the typed-f64 raw path
fixes them. Benches added for the whole family (documents the domination).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — argmax/argmin_axis1 (arg_extrema) typed-f64 path: ~1.54x@1M WIN (same per-cell smell as idxmax)
arg_extrema_axis1 (the argmax_axis1/argmin_axis1 helper, numeric-only sister of idxmax/idxmin_axis1) had the
identical per-cell smell: col.values()[row_idx] (n*m BTreeMap) + Scalar + to_f64() per cell -> ~0.40x loss
(same as idxmax was). Applied the typed-f64 path (largest-parameterized): all-valid Float64 -> raw f64
compare over hoisted slices, first-wins, NaN skipped. Bit-identical (argmax 8/0). MEASURED (new
df_argmax_axis1 bench vs pandas idxmax): 1.54x@1M WIN (fp 70ms vs pandas 109ms). Slightly behind idxmax's
2.66x because the `if largest` take-branch runs per cell (not hoisted) — could split the row loop on
largest for ~2.6x (minor follow-up; near-duplicate of idxmax). The axis=1 idxmax/idxmin/argmax/argmin
family all now win.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — argmax/argmin_axis1 branchless sign trick: 1.54x->2.60x@1M (matches idxmax)
Follow-up: the `if largest` take-branch per cell held argmax_axis1 at 1.54x (vs idxmax's 2.66x). Replaced
with a branchless sign trick: track max(sign*v) where sign=+1 (argmax) or -1 (argmin) — the col with the
smallest v has the largest -v. 1.0*v optimizes to v so argmax matches idxmax. Bit-identical (argmax 8/0;
min=max-of-negated, first-wins, NaN skipped). MEASURED: 70448->40216us@1M = ~1.75x fp-side -> 1.54x->2.60x.
LESSON: a loop-invariant branch in a hot per-cell loop costs ~half; a sign/mask trick removes it. The axis=1
idx/arg family is now uniformly ~2.6x (idxmax 2.66x, idxmin 2.57x, argmax/argmin 2.60x).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — per-cell-smell sweep COMPLETE (vein exhausted)
Systematic grep for the per-cell self.columns[name].values()[row_idx] smell (n*m BTreeMap lookups in
row*col loops) across fp-frame: ALL hot-loop sites now fixed (to_json ×5, to_dict ×3, to_records, apply,
idxmax/idxmin/argmax/argmin_axis1, rank_axis1). The ONLY remaining match is the truncated Display/__repr__
(loops over `show`~=10 display rows, not n — not a smell at scale). corrwith's per-column path uses cheap
Arc column clones + the alien-optimized corr (not a per-cell loss; the 48526 flag was a stale line number).
The per-cell-hoist / typed-slice lever is comprehensively applied. AXIS=1 FAMILY uniform ~2.6x (idx/arg) +
6-340x (reductions). Tractable @1M frontier comprehensively conquered; only structural survivors remain
(unstack string-MultiIndex, daily/sub-daily resample gather-agg, to_numpy/transpose 2D-block — br-ikq9a/l4vzc).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — 4th MEASUREMENT PHANTOM + real loss: STRING-KEY groupby aggs all lose
CORRECTION: the earlier "groupby_mean_str 3.65x WIN" was a DATA MISMATCH — the fp bench is a SERIES groupby
(val_series.groupby(key).mean(), 1 col) but I compared it to a pandas DATAFRAME groupby (dsk.groupby("k").
mean(), 10 cols, which is ~17x slower in pandas). Correctly compared (Series vs Series, both 1 col):
  groupby_mean_str 0.22x, groupby_std_str 0.25x, groupby_var_str 0.19x, groupby_median_str 0.61x — ALL LOSS.
fp ~16-30ms (all aggs) vs pandas ~3-4ms. ROOT CAUSE: fp's string-key build_groups (SipHash on 1M strings ->
~1000 groups) + agg_numeric's SCATTERED per-group gather (group indices are non-contiguous since the key
derives from random col_0) — vs pandas factorize + cache-friendly C grouped reduction. The int64-dense
bypass (memory) is INT64-ONLY; string keys have no fast path. FIX (filed): single-pass dense-by-code
(factorize string keys -> codes, single pass accumulating sum/count/sumsq per code — no build_groups, no
scattered gather) for the count-based aggs (mean/sum/std/var/count); median needs the gather (harder). Also
check if build_groups uses std-SipHash (FxHashMap = partial). 4TH measurement phantom (--size, value_counts
data-mismatch, no-warmup, now groupby DataFrame-vs-Series). LESSON: match the SHAPE (Series vs DataFrame) too.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — groupby family CORRECTED scorecard (Series-vs-Series): more phantoms + losses
Re-verified ALL groupby benches with correct SHAPE (fp Series-groupby-1-col vs pandas Series-groupby-1-col;
earlier I'd compared to pandas DataFrame-groupby-10-cols = ~17x inflation). Honest @1M:
  WINS (real): groupby_cumcount 7.56x, groupby_transform_mean 1.54x, df_groupby_str_sum 5.99x (DataFrame,
    correctly matched).
  LOSSES (string-key, br-ih2if): mean_str 0.22x, std_str 0.25x, var_str 0.19x, median_str 0.61x.
  BORDERLINE: groupby_count (int-key) ~0.60x — even the int-DENSE path loses to pandas Series count here.
So the earlier groupby "14-59x wins" were partly the DataFrame-vs-Series shape phantom. The string-key aggs
+ count are real losses; cumcount/transform/df-sum are real wins. 4TH PHANTOM CLASS = shape-mismatch
(Series vs DataFrame). The groupby loss family (string-key aggs + count) is br-ih2if (dense-by-code fix).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — 6th measurement subtlety: groupby "loss family" was GROUPER CACHING; fp WINS inline + single-pass mean shipped
CORRECTION of the prior groupby-loss finding: it was a measurement artifact (grouper caching), NOT a real
loss. My comparison did `g = val.groupby(key); pm(lambda: g.mean())` — pandas CACHES the grouper in `g`, so
I measured pandas' REDUCTION-ONLY (~3.5ms) vs fp's FULL groupby (factorize+reduce, ~16ms). The fp bench does
`.groupby().mean()` INLINE (full work each call). The fair single-agg comparison (pandas inline, no cached
g): groupby mean_str 3.52x, std_str 2.32x, var_str 2.28x, median_str 2.09x — ALL WIN (pandas inline ~40ms
for the string-key factorize+reduce; fp ~12-29ms). count also re-checked inline. So fp WINS the single-agg
groupby; pandas only wins the AMORTIZED multi-agg case (g cached across mean()+std()+...), which fp doesn't
amortize (separate concern). 6TH subtlety: match the CALL PATTERN (inline vs cached grouper) too.
SHIPPED (real fp-side improvement regardless): SeriesGroupBy::mean single-pass dense path — accumulate
sum/count per gid via dense_group_ids (int64 OR contiguous-Utf8) in ONE pass, no per-group Vec<f64> buckets +
func re-scan. Bit-identical (groupby 202/0). 16096->11526us@1M = ~1.4x fp-side -> 2.5x->3.52x more domination.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy sum single-pass (sister to mean): df_groupby_str_sum 5.99x->6.88x
Extended the dense single-pass lever to SeriesGroupBy::sum: accumulate sum per gid via dense_group_ids
(int64 OR contiguous-Utf8 key) in ONE sequential pass, skipping agg_numeric's per-group Vec<f64> buckets +
func re-scan. Bit-identical (groupby 202/0; first-seen gids/labels, value-order sum == nums.iter().sum(),
Float64 output). MEASURED: df_groupby_str_sum (DataFrame .sum() = per-column SeriesGroupBy sum) 5.99x->6.88x
@1M. mean still 3.45x (unbroken). The groupby family (inline single-agg) now: mean 3.45x, sum 6.88x, std
2.32x, var 2.28x, median 2.09x, count 5.92x, cumcount 7.56x, transform 1.54x — ALL WIN, mean+sum now
single-pass (no buckets). std/var (two-pass by code) + median (needs the per-group bucket) are the same
lever, follow-up (they already win, the single-pass is more domination).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy var/std two-pass-by-code: var 2.28x->3.52x, std 2.32x->2.45x
Completed the dense single-pass lever for the COUNT-BASED groupby reductions. var: two sequential passes
over dense gids (pass 1 sum/count -> mean; pass 2 sum of (x-mean).powi(2)), no per-group Vec<f64> buckets +
the closure's own double-rescan. std follows (calls var). Bit-identical (groupby 202/0; first-seen
gids/labels, value-order sums, (x-mean).powi(2), NaN for n<2, ssd/(n-1)). MEASURED @1M: var 17725->12793us
(3.52x), std 17725->16848us (2.45x). GROUPBY REDUCTIONS NOW ALL SINGLE-PASS: mean 3.45x, sum 6.88x, var
3.52x, std 2.45x. median KEEPS the bucket (order stat needs the per-group values for the sort — single-pass
inapplicable; already wins 2.09x inline). NOTE: the gid+order prologue is now duplicated 3x (mean/sum/var) —
optional consolidation into a dense_group_layout helper (would add a cheap order-only pass; kept inline for
the single-pass speed). All bit-identical, conformance green.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — multi-agg groupby ALSO a WIN (1.33x): fp fully dominates, no grouper cache needed
Tested the one scenario I'd flagged as a possible fp loss — the AMORTIZED multi-agg (g = groupby(key);
g.mean(); g.std(); g.var(), pandas caches the grouper in g). Added groupby_multi_str bench. @1M: fp=43279us
vs pandas(cached g)=57727us -> 1.33x WIN. fp REBUILDS the dense gids 3x but each build (~5ms byte-span
FxHash) is far cheaper than pandas' ONE string factorize (~37ms), so 3x fp rebuild (~15ms) still beats
pandas' amortized factorize (37ms + 3x3.5ms reduce). So fp dominates groupby in BOTH the single-agg AND the
multi-agg pattern — the "amortized multi-agg" concern is moot. OPTIONAL more-domination lever (NOT needed to
win): cache dense_group_ids in the SeriesGroupBy via OnceCell + return &[usize] (no single-agg clone
regression) -> 1x build -> est ~1.75x. Filed/noted, not shipped (fp already wins; moderate struct refactor).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy min/max single-pass via dense_group_fold helper: 3.25x/3.23x
Extended the dense single-pass lever to min/max (after their Utf8/Timedelta dtype guards) via a reusable
dense_group_fold(init, fold, finish) helper — one sequential pass folds per gid (f64::min/f64::max), no
per-group Vec<f64> buckets + iter().fold re-scan. Bit-identical (groupby 202/0; first-seen gids/labels,
value-order fold == bucket fold, Float64 output matching agg_numeric, f64::min/max ignore NaN same as the
closure). MEASURED @1M (NEW benches groupby_min_str/groupby_max_str): min 3.25x, max 3.23x WIN (fp ~12.2ms
vs pandas inline ~39.5ms). The helper is reusable — mean/sum could be rewired onto it (var stays two-pass);
left inline for now (shipped+green). GROUPBY now: mean 3.45x/sum 6.88x/var 3.52x/std 2.45x/min 3.25x/max
3.23x/median 2.09x/count 5.92x/cumcount 7.56x/transform 1.54x/multi-agg 1.33x — ALL WIN.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — consolidated mean/sum onto dense_group_fold (removed ~80 lines duplication)
Refactored SeriesGroupBy mean+sum to call the dense_group_fold helper (mean: fold a+x, finish a/n; sum:
fold a+x, finish a) instead of their duplicated inline gid+order blocks. Removed ~80 lines. Bit-identical
(groupby 202/0; mean 3.54x, sum df 7.15x — unchanged within variance). Now the dense single-pass lever lives
in ONE helper (mean/sum/min/max) + the var two-pass inline; no 5x duplication. Conformance green.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — DataFrame-level groupby (int64 key) also dominates: var 2.49x, mean 4.00x
Probed the one untested groupby path — the int64-key DataFrame groupby (df.groupby(["k"]).var()/mean(),
multi-column). Added df_groupby_int_var/df_groupby_int_mean benches. @1M: var 2.49x, mean 4.00x WIN. The
DataFrame groupby delegates per-column to SeriesGroupBy, so it inherits the dense single-pass lever (var
two-pass-by-code, mean single-fold). No loss. GROUPBY IS NOW EXHAUSTIVELY VERIFIED AS A WIN: Series + DataFrame,
string + int64 keys, single-agg + multi-agg, all reductions (sum/mean/var/std/min/max/count) + cumcount +
transform — EVERY combination dominates pandas 1.3-7.6x @1M, all bit-identical / conformance green.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy prod single-pass via dense_group_fold: 3.75x
Routed prod through dense_group_fold(1.0, |a,x| a*x, |a,_| Float64(a)) (after its Timedelta guard) — one
sequential fold per gid, no buckets. Bit-identical (groupby 202/0): 1.0*x0*x1*... folds left-to-right in
value order == nums.iter().product()'s left fold. New bench groupby_prod_str: 3.75x@1M WIN. Now EVERY
agg_numeric-using SeriesGroupBy reduction is single-pass (mean/sum/min/max/prod via the helper, var/std
two-pass inline). Remaining: sem/skew (agg_values_scalar — need all values, like median; bit-identity vs
nansem/nanskew not worth the risk) + median (bucket order stat) — both already WIN inline.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — agg_values_scalar dense-bucket: groupby sem 0.70x->1.19x, skew 0.72x->1.32x (REAL losses flipped)
Found the LAST real groupby losses: sem 0.70x, skew 0.72x @1M (inline, fair). Root cause: agg_values_scalar
(the path sem/skew/value-aggs use) still used build_groups + a SCATTERED per-group values()[idx] gather —
the slow path agg_numeric escaped long ago. Added the dense-bucket fast path (dense_group_ids int64/Utf8 ->
push each row's Scalar into its per-gid bucket in ONE sequential pass, no build_groups map, no scattered
gather). Bit-identical (groupby 202/0; first-seen gids/labels, value-order buckets, same func, same nullable
preservation). MEASURED @1M: sem 62000->36366us (0.70x->1.19x WIN), skew ->33936us (0.72x->1.32x WIN). This
path is shared, so ALL agg_values_scalar aggs benefit. NOW the groupby surface has ZERO known losses.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — groupby nunique 0.88x->3.08x (std SipHash HashSet + scattered gather -> dense+Fx)
groupby nunique was a 0.88x LOSS @1M (fp 180ms). TWO smells: (1) std `HashSet::new()` = SipHash (the crate
uses FxHashSet); (2) the agg_scalar indices path = build_groups + scattered per-row `values()[idx]` gather.
Fix: route through the now-dense agg_values_scalar (sequential per-gid value buckets) + FxHashSet. Bit-
identical (groupby 202/0): distinct count is order-independent (same seen.len()); FxHash changes bucketing
not cardinality. MEASURED: 180709->48754us@1M = 0.88x->3.08x WIN (3.7x fp-side). The std-HashSet-on-hot-path
smell strikes again (cf pivot SipHash). NEXT: any/all use the same agg_scalar indices path — check them.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — groupby unique 0.59x->0.83x (dense path; residual = output materialization)
groupby unique was 0.59x LOSS @1M (fp 190ms): build_groups + scattered per-row values()[idx] gather. Added a
dense path (dense_group_ids -> per-gid FxHashSet + first-seen Vec in one sequential pass, then emit
group-major), bit-identical (groupby 202/0; first-seen group + value order, missing-once semantics preserved).
190->134ms = 0.59x->0.83x (1.4x fp-side). STILL a marginal loss — residual is the 1M-Scalar output build
(out_values Vec<Scalar> + from_values). NEXT: typed f64 output (collect uniques as Vec<f64> + from_f64_values,
dedup on bits) to close to a win.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — multi-func groupby agg(["mean","std","max"]) 0.63x LOSS (per-func rebuild)
SeriesGroupBy::agg(funcs) loops funcs calling each per-func method (self.mean(), self.std(), ...), so it
REBUILDS the dense gids per func (and std re-derives via var = another build) — N gid builds + N full passes
vs pandas' amortized grouper (factorize once + N reductions). @1M agg(["mean","std","max"]): fp=73120us vs
pandas=46016us -> 0.63x LOSS. Bench groupby_agg3_str added. FIX (filed): (a) gid cache — OnceCell<Option<
(Vec<usize>,usize)>> field on SeriesGroupBy (struct is 2 fields/1 ctor) + dense_group_ids returns &[usize]
(no single-agg clone regression); amortizes the N gid builds (partial, ~0.79x est). (b) buckets-once (the
real flip) — agg(funcs) builds gids+buckets ONCE then applies each func over the shared buckets, one result
DataFrame. Focused rewrite, not an end-of-session blind edit. NOTE: this also caps the multi-agg gid-cache
lever (1.33x->~1.75x).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — agg_values_scalar fix reaches all value-aggs: kurt 3.63x, quantile 2.10x WIN
Confirmed the agg_values_scalar dense-bucket fix (sem/skew) is SHARED: kurt and quantile use the same path
and are now wins too. @1M: groupby_kurt_str 3.63x, groupby_quantile_str 2.10x WIN. So ALL groupby value-aggs
(sem/skew/kurt/quantile/nunique/unique) + the single-pass reductions (mean/sum/var/std/min/max/prod/count) +
median/cumcount/transform dominate pandas. The ONLY remaining groupby loss is multi-func agg(funcs) (br-4h46q,
filed — needs buckets-once amortization). Groupby surface = comprehensively dominated, one filed exception.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample value-aggs MARGINAL (std 0.92x, median 1.04x) — NOT the groupby pattern
Checked whether the groupby value-agg slow path (build_groups + scattered gather) repeats in resample
(groupby-by-time). It does NOT meaningfully: resample bins are CONTIGUOUS (time-sorted), so aggregate_scalar's
per-bin gather is sequential (no cache-miss scatter). The only overhead vs mean (which has a typed-f64 path)
is the values() Scalar materialization + per-bin Vec<Scalar>. @1M: resample_std 0.92x LOSS (fp 25.6ms vs
pandas 23.5ms, ~2ms gap), resample_median 1.04x WIN. The ~2ms is the Scalar materialization; a typed
aggregate_scalar_f64 path would skip it but RISKS the fp_types::nanstd/nanvar bit-identity (exact float
op order -> golden regen) for a marginal gain — NOT pursued (revert-~0-gain discipline). Benches
resample_std/resample_median added for coverage. CONTRAST: groupby's scattered gather made sem 0.70x (big,
fixed); resample's contiguous bins make std only 0.92x (marginal, left).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — expanding skew/kurt 0.14-0.22x LOSS (output Scalar cache-miss) + 7th subtlety
expanding().skew()/kurt() are O(n) online (expanding_moment_online) but a real LOSS: @100k 0.22x, @1M 0.14x
(fp 195ms vs pandas 27ms), SUPER-LINEAR (17.9x for 10x). Root: the per-row output builds a Vec<Scalar>
(~32MB@1M) + Column::from_values re-scan — the 32MB Vec blows L3 -> cache-miss super-linearity. The INPUT
values() Scalar materialization is NOT the bench cost (tried as_f64_slice input skip -> only ~5% -> REVERTED
per revert-~0-gain): the bench reuses the series so values() is amortized/cached (7TH MEASUREMENT SUBTLETY =
bench series-reuse caches values(), hiding input-materialization cost; real one-shot usage would pay it).
FIX (filed): typed output — output_skew_typed/output_kurt_typed -> (f64, present_bool), collect Vec<f64> +
ValidityMask, Column::from_f64_values_with_validity (4x smaller, no re-scan). Bit-identity risk = the
missing-slot underlying value (Null(NaN) vs validity-false NaN) -> golden gate. Bench expanding_skew added.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — multi-key int64 groupby WINS 2.45x (dense multi-key path)
Checked whether multi-key groupby (df.groupby(["k1","k2"])) falls to the slow build_groups path (dense_group_ids
is single-key only). For INT64 keys it does NOT: df_groupby_2key_sum @1M = 2.45x WIN (fp 23.8ms vs pandas 58ms)
— the int64_dense_grouping combines the keys densely. Confirms the memory's "multi-key int64 already dense".
Bench added. (Multi-string-key may differ — no int64 dense; checking next if disk allows.)

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — multi-STRING-key groupby 0.89x MARGINAL loss (no multi-key dense for strings)
Contrast to multi-int-key (2.45x win): df.groupby(["k1_str","k2_str"]).sum() @1M = 0.89x LOSS (fp 122ms vs
pandas 108ms). The int64_dense_grouping combines INT keys densely, but multi-STRING keys have no dense path
-> build_groups + scattered gather. Marginal (0.89x, not the big single-key value-agg losses). FIX (noted,
not filed as separate — marginal): a multi-key dense path that factorizes each key column to codes + combines
(like int64_dense_grouping generalized to Utf8/mixed). Involved for a ~0.89x->~1.5x marginal gain; lower
priority than the architectural/golden-gated items. Bench df_groupby_2strkey_sum added.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — comprehensive measurement-only confirmation sweep (no build): joins + hash-ops all WIN
Disk-constrained (no rebuild), re-verified the categories most likely to hide a loss (after the groupby
value-agg + grouper-caching finds). ALL WIN inline vs pandas @1M:
  GROUPBY (warm binary, all intact, no regression): mean 3.55x/var 3.30x/std 2.64x/min 3.27x/max 3.39x/
    prod 3.63x/median 2.08x/sem 1.21x/skew 1.36x/nunique 2.73x; unique 0.96x (~parity).
  HASH-OPS (dataframe_ops): value_counts 4.53x, df_duplicated 48.8x, df_nunique 10.4x, df_mode 2.40x.
  JOINS (inline, fair — NO grouper-caching/shape artifact here, unlike groupby): join_inner 2.31x,
    join_left 3.75x, join_outer 3.38x, join_inner_str 9.72x.
CONCLUSION: fp dominates pandas across groupby + hash-ops + joins, measured honestly. The session's ~14
groupby fixes are confirmed intact. Remaining losses are ONLY the filed/golden-gated/architectural/marginal
items (expanding skew/kurt br-nsyti, multi-func agg br-4h46q, multi-string-key + to_numpy/transpose l4vzc,
resample std 0.92x). The tractable bit-identical single-commit frontier is comprehensively conquered.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — final all-category confirmation: f64-df + rolling WIN; sort honest number resolved
Completed the measurement-only sweep across the remaining categories (no build). @1M inline:
  sort_values_single 2.51x WIN (resolves the memory's CONFLICTING 0.91x [100k no-warmup phantom] vs 34.8x
    [inflated] — the honest warmed-@1M number is 2.51x), cumsum 20.77x, rolling_mean_w10 2.69x, rolling_std_w50 1.97x.
EVERY major category is now verified-dominant INLINE this session: groupby (all aggs/keys), hash-ops
(value_counts/duplicated/nunique/mode), joins (inner/left/outer/str), f64-df (sort/cumsum), rolling. fp
DOMINATES pandas across the entire measured surface, honestly. The only non-wins are the
filed/golden-gated/architectural/marginal items (expanding skew/kurt br-nsyti, multi-func agg br-4h46q,
multi-string-key/to_numpy/transpose l4vzc, resample std 0.92x, unique 0.96x). FRONTIER CONQUERED.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — groupby rank WINS 4.43x (build_groups != universal loss)
Checked another unbenched sibling: SeriesGroupBy::rank uses build_groups (per the memory), so a value-agg-style
loss candidate. But it WINS: groupby_rank_str @1M = 4.43x (fp 61ms vs pandas 270ms). pandas' groupby.rank is
slow; fp's per-group rank (even via build_groups) beats it. CONFIRMS the build_groups path is NOT a universal
loss — the value-aggs (sem/skew/nunique) lost specifically due to the scattered per-row values()[idx] gather
+ Scalar materialization + std-SipHash, all now fixed. groupby surface fully checked: every agg + rank +
cumcount + transform WINS; only multi-func agg (br-4h46q) + multi-string-key (architectural) remain.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — pivot_table value-aggs WIN (std 1.37x, median 1.20x) — pattern doesn't repeat
Checked the last place the groupby value-agg scattered pattern could repeat: pivot_table with aggfunc=std/median
(my agg_values_scalar fix was SeriesGroupBy-only). With INT keys (r=i%100, c=i%10) it WINS: df_pivot_table_std
1.37x, df_pivot_table_median 1.20x @1M — the int-keyed pivot grouping is dense, no scattered gather. The
groupby value-agg loss cluster was specific to STRING-keyed groupby (scattered + Scalar materialization +
SipHash); int-keyed grouping (groupby OR pivot) is dense and wins. SWEEP COMPLETE: every benched op + every
unbenched sibling checked (groupby aggs/rank/transform, hash-ops, joins, f64-df, rolling, pivot value-aggs)
DOMINATES. Only filed/golden-gated/architectural/marginal items remain.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — multi-func groupby agg 0.63x->2.63x WIN (buckets-once) — br-4h46q CLOSED
Fixed the last tractable groupby loss. SeriesGroupBy::agg(funcs) (the REAL one @28194, not the Expanding agg
I'd first misread) did N+1 group builds: one build_groups for the order + a per-func method per func, each
rebuilding the dense gids. Buckets-once fast path: build dense gids + per-gid f64 buckets ONCE, then apply
every f64-bucket func (sum/mean/min/max/std/var/prod) over the shared buckets. Bit-identical (groupby 202/0):
each func over the value-order bucket == its standalone result (mean=sum/n, std=sqrt(ssd/(n-1)) matching the
var two-pass, prod=left-fold), same first-seen order/labels, same by-name index. count excluded (Int64).
MEASURED: groupby_agg3_str(["mean","std","max"]) 73120->17771us@1M = 0.63x->2.63x WIN (4.1x fp-side). Non-
bucket funcs (median/sem/skew/kurt) fall back to the per-func loop. The groupby surface now has ZERO losses.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample.agg(multi-func) 0.38x LOSS (same per-func rebuild as groupby agg)
Same pattern as the groupby multi-func agg (just fixed): Resample::agg(funcs) @23037 does N+1 build_groups
(one for order + aggregate_named per func, each rebuilding the bins). resample_agg3(["mean","std","max"]) @1M
= 0.38x LOSS (fp 88ms vs pandas 33ms). FIX (filed br): buckets-once — build the bins + per-bin buckets ONCE,
apply each func over the shared buckets. NUANCE vs groupby: resample funcs reuse fp_types nan_* (nansum/
nanmean/nanstd/nanvar/nanprod/nanmedian/nanmin/nanmax), so for bit-identity either (a) Scalar buckets +
reuse the EXACT nan_func per func (guaranteed bit-identical, est 0.38x->~parity since the Scalar
materialization is the floor), or (b) F64 buckets + own funcs (a clear win, but ONLY if fp_types::nanvar ==
the mean-centered two-pass sum((x-mean).powi(2))/(n-1) — must verify, else golden-breaking). Bench
resample_agg3 added. Less common than groupby agg; focused effort.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample.agg(multi-func) 0.38x->1.48x WIN (buckets-once) — br-833wx CLOSED
Fixed the resample multi-func agg with the F64 buckets-once (same lever as the groupby agg). Verified the
nan_* bit-identity first: fp_types::nanvar IS the mean-centered two-pass (mean=sum/n; sum((x-mean).powi(2))/
(n-ddof)) == my f64 var; nansum/nanmean/nanmin/nanmax/nanprod == plain fold/sum over a finite bucket. So the
F64 buckets-once (build per-bin f64 buckets ONCE, apply each func) is bit-identical (resample 51/0), gated on
no-NaN + non-empty bins (n<2 var/std -> Null(NaN) matching nanvar). MEASURED: resample_agg3 87951->22445us@1M
= 0.38x->1.48x WIN (3.9x fp-side). BOTH multi-func agg per-func-rebuild losses now fixed (groupby cbec50cd +
resample). Rolling/Expanding/Ewm aggs don't share the pattern (online passes, no build_groups).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — turn summary: both multi-func agg per-func-rebuild losses FIXED
Found + fixed the per-func-rebuild pattern in BOTH places it occurs (build_groups-based aggs):
  groupby.agg(["mean","std","max"]) 0.63x->2.63x (buckets-once, cbec50cd, br-4h46q)
  resample.agg(["mean","std","max"]) 0.38x->1.48x (F64 buckets-once, d6289821, br-833wx)
Rolling/Expanding/Ewm aggs DON'T share it (online passes, no group rebuild). UNBLOCKED follow-up (marginal,
not done): single-agg resample std/var 0.92x — now that fp_types::nanvar is verified == the mean-centered
two-pass, a typed std/var fast path (skip the input Scalar materialization, like resample.mean) is provably
bit-identical and would flip it to ~1.1x; left as a marginal ~parity candidate (lower value than the
multi-func wins). Remaining non-wins: golden-gated (expanding skew/kurt br-nsyti), architectural
(multi-string-key, to_numpy/transpose l4vzc), marginal (resample single std/var 0.92x, unique 0.96x).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample single std/var 0.92x->1.21x (typed two-pass) — marginal loss flipped
Flipped the last marginal resample loss now that nanvar's two-pass formula is verified. Added
Resample::resample_var_typed (std/var route through it): typed two-pass per bin from as_f64_slice, skipping
the per-bin Vec<Scalar> gather + nan_* dispatch aggregate_scalar pays per call (the per-call cost; values()
is cached by the bench's series reuse). Bit-identical (resample 51/0): == fp_types::nanvar (n<=1 -> Null),
nanstd == sqrt; gated on f64 + no-NaN (Timedelta/NaN keep the nan_* path). MEASURED: resample_std
25600->19724us@1M = 0.92x->1.21x WIN. THREE agg-investigation fixes this turn: groupby.agg 0.63->2.63x,
resample.agg 0.38->1.48x, resample std/var 0.92->1.21x. resample_median still 1.04x (nanmedian sort, fine).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample typed min/max 0.80x->0.94x (~parity); build_groups is the floor
Added Resample::resample_extremum_typed (min/max route through it): per-bin reduce with strict </> over
as_f64_slice, bit-identical to nanmin/nanmax (keeps first extreme so -0.0/0.0 ties match; empty bin ->
Null(NaN)). resample_max 21738->19573us@1M = 0.80x->0.94x (still ~parity), resample_sum 1.01x (~parity).
RESIDUAL / FLOOR: the typed funcs eliminated the per-bin Vec<Scalar> gather, leaving build_groups (the per-bin
Vec<usize> materialization, ~8MB@1M) as the shared floor — pandas computes bin BOUNDARIES and reduces over
contiguous slices without materializing per-bin index vecs. The deeper lever for ALL single-agg resample
(sum/min/max/std/var ~parity) is build_groups returning contiguous (start,end) ranges instead of Vec<usize>
(architectural-ish, contiguous bins only). Typed mean/std/var/min/max done; remaining resample single-aggs
are ~parity at the build_groups floor.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample build_groups floor: assessed, deferred (architectural, marginal)
Read Resample::build_groups @22840 -> delegates to free fn resample_build_groups(labels, freq) returning
(Vec<String> order, HashMap<String, Vec<usize>>). The Vec<usize> per bin (~8MB@1M) is the residual floor for
the resample single-aggs now at ~parity (sum 1.01x / min,max 0.94x). A boundary version returning
(label, start, end) per contiguous bin would let the typed aggs slice as_f64_slice[start..end] with no
Vec<usize> — but it requires RE-IMPLEMENTING the freq bucketing + empty-bin-fill (eov68) logic to emit ranges
(empty bin -> start==end), an involved architectural change for a marginal gain (the affected ops are already
~parity). DEFERRED (disk dropping 56G, marginal EV). The typed mean/std/var/min/max + multi-func buckets-once
already eliminated the per-bin Vec<Scalar> gather (the bigger cost); the Vec<usize> floor is shared with the
generic path and lower-value.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample floor CONFIRMED inherent (don't re-chase)
Read resample_build_groups @22257: it is ALREADY optimized — a prior dense-scatter rewrite (br-eov68 era)
replaced the per-row groups.get_mut(key) SipHash with `dense[bidx].push(i)` by bucket index (the comment
says so), and bucket-key Strings are built per-bucket not per-row. The remaining floor is just (a) the
per-row month-ordinal conversion (labels.map(resample_label_to_month_ordinal)) and (b) the dense Vec<usize>
per bucket — both O(n) INHERENT work pandas also does (bin assignment). So the resample single-agg ~parity
(sum 1.01x / min,max 0.94x after the typed paths removed the Scalar gather) is genuine, NOT a fixable
inefficiency. The only marginal lever left is the architectural build_bin_ranges (avoid the 8MB Vec<usize>),
deferred. CONCLUSION: resample is fully optimized to its inherent floor — don't re-chase the single-aggs.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — serialization re-verified ALL WIN; df_to_records 100k anomaly (single-size artifact)
Re-verified IO/serialization (the one un-rechecked category). @100k inline: json_write_records 3.15x /
columns 2.91x / split 3.82x / values 3.77x, df_to_dict_records 6.28x / dict 7.08x — all WIN. df_to_records
showed 0.19x @100k, which looked like a loss — but re-measured across sizes it is NON-MONOTONIC: 10k 1.46x,
100k 0.19x, 1M 1.25x WIN. BOTH sides are anomalous at 100k (pandas 10k->100k only 2.8x = anomalously fast;
fp 10k->100k 21x = anomalously slow — likely a cache/allocator boundary for the per-row Vec<Vec<Scalar>>
around 100k×11 Scalars ~17MB). At the bench size (1M) AND 10k, fp WINS (matching the predecessor's 1.56x).
7TH MEASUREMENT SUBTLETY: a SINGLE-SIZE point can be a double-sided anomaly — re-measure at 10k/100k/1M and
trust the trend, not one point. No fix: df_to_records wins at realistic sizes. Serialization fully dominant.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — indexing all WIN; ALL-CATEGORY inline re-verification COMPLETE
Indexing @1M inline: loc_labels 14.26x (the batch resolver fix holds), reindex 14.20x, iloc_slice 4.72x — WIN.
This completes the all-category inline re-verification this session. EVERY major category confirmed dominant
vs pandas @1M (honest, inline, multi-size where anomalies suspected):
  groupby (all aggs/rank/transform/multi-key/multi-func) | hash-ops (value_counts/duplicated/nunique/mode) |
  joins (inner/left/outer/str) | f64-df (sort/cumsum) | rolling (mean/std) | serialization (json/dict/records) |
  datetime resample (mean/std/var/min/max/multi-func + inherent floor) | indexing (loc/reindex/iloc).
fp DOMINATES pandas across the ENTIRE measured surface, verified not assumed. The only non-wins are the
filed/gated items: golden-gated (expanding skew/kurt powf br-nsyti), architectural (multi-string-key,
to_numpy/transpose l4vzc, resample build_bin_ranges), inherent-floor ~parity (resample sum/min/max, unique).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — multi-string-key groupby 0.89x: root = GroupKey string hash; fix involved, deferred
Assessed the last tractable-ish loss. DataFrameGroupBy::build_groups @59572 has a dense fast path gated on
SINGLE key (self.by[0] + as_i64_slice + i64_dense_histogram_range). Multi-key (any count) falls to the generic
GroupKey<'_> path: per-row hash of the composite key. For multi-INT keys that's a cheap i64 hash (2.45x WIN);
for multi-STRING keys it's the expensive &str composite hash (0.89x LOSS) vs pandas' factorize-each-key.
FIX (not done, low-EV): a multi-key dense path — factorize each key column to i64 codes, combine
(code1*n2+code2 -> dense composite key), run the existing int64_dense_grouping; the GroupKey->index output is
unchanged so it's NOT a MultiIndex rewrite (tractable) but the multi-key factorize+combine is involved for a
marginal 0.89x->~1.5x gain on a less-common op. DEFERRED (low EV, disk-tight). The single-string-key groupby
(common) already wins via the contiguous-Utf8 dense path; only the multi-string composite is at the generic
hash floor.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — multi-string-key groupby 0.89x->1.12x via GroupMap FxHashMap (br-buguz)
The multi-string-key loss root was the GENERIC DataFrameGroupBy build_groups using std HashMap (SipHash) for
the per-row composite GroupKey<&str,&str> hash (type GroupMap @1126 + 4 constructions, the generic @59740
being the per-row one). Converted GroupMap to FxHashMap (rustc_hash). Bit-identical: the output group ORDER
is group_order-determined (first-seen row order, separate from the map) and groups[key]=positions are the same
regardless of hasher — only the internal bucketing changes. MEASURED: df_groupby_2strkey_sum 0.89x->1.12x@1M
(122->94ms), groupby 202/0 green. This was the SIMPLE proven lever (FxHashMap), NOT the involved
factorize+combine I'd assessed — and it helps ALL generic multi-key/composite/Bool/Float64-key groupby, not
just multi-string. br-buguz resolved. The last tractable groupby loss is now a WIN.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — groupby COMPLETELY dominant (multi-string-key fixed); other FxHashMap beads unmeasured
After the GroupMap FxHashMap fix (multi-string-key 0.89x->1.12x), checked the sibling FxHashMap beads:
str_value_counts (string key "g{i%1000}") @1M = 4.19x WIN — value_counts uses a TYPED contiguous-Utf8 path,
so br-g1de8 (value_counts/mode general FxHashMap) + br-6vep3 (unique/dedup general FxHashMap) have NO measured
loss (the typed/dense paths win every benched case; the SipHash "general" path is only hit by non-typed/mixed
columns that aren't benched). Only br-buguz (the DFGroupBy GroupMap) had a measured loss (the per-row
composite GroupKey hash on multi-key). GROUPBY IS NOW COMPLETELY DOMINANT: every agg/rank/transform,
single+multi key (int AND string), single+multi func — ALL WIN @1M. The remaining non-wins are ONLY
golden-gated (expanding skew/kurt br-nsyti), architectural (to_numpy/transpose l4vzc), inherent-floor
(resample sum/min/max), ~parity (unique 0.96x).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — bead-flagged boolean/dedup ops all WIN; no measured loss in open perf beads
Systematically checked the benched bead-flagged ops after br-buguz: filter_bool_mask (which IS df.loc_bool,
the br-t0y8n op) 2.38x WIN, drop_duplicates 6.70x WIN @1M. So br-t0y8n (loc_bool gather) + br-6vep3
(unique/dedup FxHashMap) + br-g1de8 (value_counts FxHashMap) have NO measured loss — the typed/dense paths
win every benched case; their SipHash/gather "general" paths are only hit by non-benched mixed/object columns.
Only br-buguz (DFGroupBy GroupMap, the per-row composite-key hash) had a real measured loss, now fixed
(multi-string-key 0.89x->1.12x). The remaining open perf beads (head/tail zero-copy, dropna, RangeIndex isin,
take_positions gathers) are unbenched zero-copy/general-path improvements on ops that ALREADY win — no
measured loss to chase. EVERY measured loss this session is fixed; the surface is comprehensively dominant.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — final regression guard: ALL fixes intact (resample_std 0.77x was guard noise -> 1.29x)
Zero-build regression guard on the session's key fixes @1M: groupby sem 1.25x / nunique 3.42x / agg3
(multi-func) 2.60x / multi-string-key 1.17x / multi-int-key 2.82x / resample_agg3 1.29x — all WIN. The
GroupMap FxHashMap change (shared DFGroupBy path) did NOT regress the multi-int-key (2.82x). resample_std
showed 0.77x in the few-iteration guard (pm it=4, single fp read) — a SINGLE-MEASUREMENT ANOMALY (the 7th
subtlety in action): careful re-measure (fp min-of-3, pandas min-of-8 warmed) = 1.29x WIN. LESSON REINFORCED:
the regression GUARD itself needs adequate iterations or it false-alarms; trust the careful re-measure. ALL
session fixes verified solid; no regression anywhere.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — FULL fp-frame conformance 3098/0: every session edit bit-identical, ZERO regression
Ran the complete fp-frame conformance suite (not per-category): 3098 passed, 0 failed, 15 ignored. EVERY
session edit is bit-identical — the groupby value-agg fixes (dense buckets + FxHashSet), single-pass
reductions (dense_group_fold), multi-func buckets-once (groupby+resample agg), resample typed std/var/min/max,
the multi-string-key GroupMap FxHashMap — all preserve exact output. Combined with the perf regression guard
(all fixes WIN intact) and the all-category inline verification (every category dominant @1M), the session is
COMPREHENSIVELY COMPLETE AND VERIFIED at every level: perf (every measured loss fixed), correctness (3098/0),
no regression. Remaining non-wins are ONLY golden-gated/architectural/inherent-floor/~parity, all root-caused.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — ewm_mean WIN (noise); dt_dayofyear 0.86x marginal at inherent civil floor
Re-verified the last benched ops (datetime accessors + ewm). ewm_mean: initial 0.82x was PANDAS UNDER-WARMED
noise (pm it=4) — careful (fp min-of-3, pandas min-of-8) = 2.05x WIN across all spans (8th single-measurement
anomaly this session; even re-checks need iterations). dt_floor 1.24x, to_datetime 3.81x WIN. dt_dayofyear is
a GENUINE 0.86x marginal loss (careful: fp 15385 vs pandas 13305us@1M) — but it's ALREADY fully typed
(typed_datetime_dayofyear_all_valid: as_datetime64_slice + datetime64_civil_from_nanos + DAYS_BEFORE +
from_i64_values, no chrono). The per-row civil-from-ns is ~the inherent floor (fp ~15ns vs pandas ~13ns/row).
The only speedup (a day-cache reusing the civil date within a day) helps ONLY sorted data = bench-gaming, NOT
a general win — so NOT pursued (discipline: don't optimize for the bench's sorted fixture). dt_dayofyear left
at its ~0.86x inherent-floor marginal. All other dt accessors + ewm WIN.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — datetime accessors fully characterized: civil is Hinnant-optimal, 3 inherent-floor marginals
Measured all dt accessors carefully @1M. WIN: dt_year 1.24x (year-only path), dt_hour 4.58x / dt_dayofweek
4.74x (typed-ns, no civil), dt_floor 1.24x, to_datetime 3.81x, + the write!-buffer ones (dt_date/time/strftime,
memory-confirmed big wins). INHERENT-FLOOR MARGINAL LOSSES: dt_month 0.96x, dt_quarter 0.91x, dt_dayofyear
0.86x — all use the FULL civil date. Read datetime64_civil_from_nanos: it IS the Howard Hinnant civil_from_days
(era/doe/yoe/doy/mp, ~10 branchless int ops, NO loops/chrono) = OPTIMAL. So these ~0.9x are the inherent floor
(optimal civil + component extraction, fp Rust ~21ns vs pandas C ~20ns/row; dayofyear lower because of the
extra DAYS_BEFORE sum). The only speedup = a day-cache reusing the civil within a day -> helps ONLY sorted
data = BENCH-GAMING, not pursued. NO general bit-identical fix. The datetime category is fully characterized:
typed-ns/year-only/write!-buffer ops dominate; the 3 full-civil-component accessors are at the optimal-civil
floor (~0.9x). Added to the inherent-floor remaining list (with resample sum/min/max, unique).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — daily/sub-daily resample re-confirmed LOSS (0.69-0.80x) — FIXABLE (single-pass), not structural
br-ikq9a had filed daily/sub-daily resample as "structural gather-agg floor". RE-MEASURED carefully @1M:
resample_daily 0.69x, resample_hourly 0.80x (consistent with the old 0.75x/0.83x — REAL, not noise; though
the pandas resample measurement IS noisy on this shared machine — monthly swung 0.73-1.10x across runs).
ROOT (fixable, NOT structural): the resample MEAN typed path (lib.rs ~22883) does build_groups (per-bin
Vec<usize>) + a per-bin GATHER (g.iter().map(|&i| vals[i]).sum()/g.len()) = TWO passes. More bins (daily/
hourly) -> more pronounced. FIX: single-pass — the bin logic in resample_build_groups already computes bidx
per row (dense[bidx].push(i)); return a bin_index-per-row (mapped to order position) instead of the Vec<usize>,
then accumulate sum[bin]/count[bin] in ONE pass for mean (and sum/min/max/std/var). Value-aggs (median/sem/
skew) still need the gather. ~2x (2-pass -> 1-pass). DEFERRED (dropping disk + involves the bidx->order
mapping + empty-bin fill; the pandas measurement noise warrants careful A/B). Updated br-ikq9a: daily/sub-daily
resample is FIXABLE single-pass, NOT structural. (Monthly mean ~parity, fewer bins.)

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — daily resample mean single-pass: 0.69x->~1.9x WIN (fp 24478->8939us, 2.74x fp-side)
DID the daily resample fix (br-ikq9a) after over-deferring it. The daily case is a LOW-RISK focused fast-path
(intercept in the resample mean typed path), NOT the risky shared build_groups refactor I'd feared. Added
daily_mean_single_pass: VERBATIM the "D" path's day_ords (ns.div_euclid(NANOS_PER_DAY)+719163) + key_of
("%Y-%m-%d") + contiguous min..=max order + empty-bin NaN, but accumulates sum[day]/count[day] in ONE pass
instead of build_groups' Vec<usize> scatter + per-bin gather (2 passes). Bit-identical (resample 51/0). fp-SIDE
MEASUREMENT (robust to the shared-machine pandas noise): resample_daily 24478->8939us = 2.74x fp-side drop ->
flips ~0.69x LOSS to ~1.9x WIN (pandas ~16879us). Monthly control unchanged (20750us). KEY LESSON: I
over-deferred citing measurement noise — but the FP-SIDE drop (fp-bench min, robust) is verifiable even when the
fp/pandas RATIO is noisy. The discipline is "measure trustworthy", and fp-vs-fp IS trustworthy here. The
sub-daily/hourly (resample_hourly 0.80x) are the SAME pattern (a sub-daily ord-based single-pass) — follow-up.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — sub-daily (hourly) resample mean single-pass: 0.80x->~1.34x (fp 20748->12408us)
Did the sub-daily follow-up (same pattern as daily). subdaily_mean_single_pass: bin = (ns-origin).div_euclid(
mult*ns_per) over H/min/s/ms/us/ns, accumulate sum/count per bin in ONE pass + verbatim the sub-day path's
bin_start key (fast civil "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS" for whole-second 4-digit years, chrono fallback) + the
dense-range gate (sparse falls back to build_groups) + EMPTY-BIN SKIP (sub-daily doesn't fill empties).
Bit-identical (resample 51/0). fp-side: resample_hourly 20748->12408us (1.67x) -> ~0.80x LOSS to ~1.34x WIN
(pandas ~16566us). Daily intact (8818us), monthly unchanged (20819us). BOTH daily AND sub-daily resample mean
now WIN — the br-ikq9a "gather-agg floor" was fixable single-pass, fully done for the mean. Other resample aggs
(sum/min/max/std/var) are ~parity (lower priority); only the architectural survivors (unstack, to_numpy/
transpose l4vzc) genuinely remain in br-ikq9a.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample sum typed path + single-pass: 0.96x->~1.05x (no typed path before)
resample sum was the BARE Scalar path (aggregate_scalar(nansum)) — NO typed fast path at all: column.values()
O(n) Scalar materialization + per-bucket Vec<Scalar> clone + gather. 0.96x LOSS monthly (fp 22905 vs pandas
22009), 1.11x slower than mean fp-side. FIX: added a typed-f64 path mirroring the mean — as_f64_slice + no-NaN
-> resample_reduce_single_pass(is_sum=true) [daily/sub-daily ONE-pass accumulate, the SAME proven code as the
mean's single-pass, is_sum just switches emit (sum vs sum/count) + daily empty-bin (0.0 vs NaN)] OR build_groups
+ typed sum [monthly: skip the Scalar materialization]. Generalized daily/subdaily_mean_single_pass ->
*_reduce_single_pass(is_sum) + a resample_reduce_single_pass dispatch (mean=false, sum=true). Bit-identical
(resample 51/0; mean 21095us + daily 9032us INTACT — generalization didn't regress them). fp-side: resample_sum
22905->20907us (monthly, flips 0.96x->~1.05x via Scalar-skip; build_groups+typed-gather is still 2-pass so
modest). Daily/sub-daily sum route through the mean's MEASURED single-pass (8939/12408us, ~2.7x/1.67x drops) —
same code path, only the emit differs, so perf is inferred from the mean (not separately benched; honest note).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — M/Q/Y/A resample reduce single-pass: calendar freqs -17-19% fp; sum(M) ~1.30x
Extended the single-pass to the LAST resample-reduction path (calendar M/Q/Y/A). monthly_reduce_single_pass:
month ordinals (resample_label_to_month_ordinal) + period_end_mo/bucket_end_mo bucketing + DIRECT bidx =
(bucket_end_mo(mo)-first)/bucket_months (no order map) + resample_month_end_key cursors + filled empties
(mean->NaN, sum->0.0); accumulate sum/count per bucket in ONE pass vs build_groups Vec<usize> scatter + gather.
Bit-identical (resample 51/0). fp-side @1M: resample_y 20703->16827 (0.79x->~0.97x), resample_q 20937->16873
(0.87x->~0.97x), resample_mean(M) 20621->17153, resample_sum(M) 20907->16987 (~0.96x->~1.30x WIN). Daily 9063 /
hourly 12392 INTACT. Q/Y now sit at the INHERENT civil-month-ord floor (~0.97x — the 1M civil year*12+month
conversions, fp Rust vs pandas C, exactly like dt_month/dt_quarter ~0.9x); the single-pass removed the GATHER,
the civil conversion is the irreducible remainder. ALL resample mean+sum now single-pass at EVERY freq family
(D / sub-daily H-min-s-ms-us-ns / M-Q-Y-A). The br-ikq9a resample "gather-agg floor" is fully closed for mean+sum.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample sweep: surface WIN except max 0.93x; min/max single-pass deferred (output-path mismatch)
Comprehensive resample sweep @1M post-fix (fp min-of-3, pandas min-of-6 warmed): resample_mean 1.28x, daily
2.01x, hourly 4.26x, sum 1.32x, median 1.07x, std 1.19x, w 1.15x, q 1.10x WIN; 2d 1.01x / y 1.03x ~par; ONLY
resample_max 0.93x LOSS. So the resample surface is comprehensively WIN except the lone marginal max. The
min/max single-pass WAS investigated: the per-bin extremum (strict >/< + ±inf init) IS bit-identical to
resample_extremum_typed's reduce (keeps first extreme, -0.0/0.0 ties match). BUT the empty-bin OUTPUT differs:
resample_extremum_typed emits Scalar::Null(NullKind::NaN) via Column::from_values, while the mean/sum single-
pass emits from_f64_values(NaN) — a valid-NaN vs a null slot. So min/max can't reuse the is_sum->kind reduce
generalization (different output column type); it needs a SEPARATE Scalar-output single-pass helper (~50 lines,
the monthly logic + extremum accumulator + Vec<Scalar> Null-for-empty emit). For a marginal 0.93x gain on a
LESS-COMMON op, with bit-identity risk on the empty-bin null path, the EV/effort says DEFER (filed br-ikq9a).
The resample reductions cluster is COMPREHENSIVELY CLOSED for the common aggs (mean+sum all freqs); max is the
lone marginal residual.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — resample max/min single-pass: 0.93x->1.00x; resample surface now has NO losses
REVERSED last turn's deferral — the min/max single-pass was NOT blocked by the output mismatch; just emit
Vec<Scalar> (Null(NaN) for empty) via from_values, matching resample_extremum_typed exactly. monthly_extremum_
single_pass: strict >/< + ±inf init (keeps first extreme, -0.0/0.0 ties match the reduce) accumulate per bucket
in ONE pass; intercept in resample_extremum_typed for M/Q/Y/A. Bit-identical (resample 51/0), mean intact
(16866us). fp-side: resample_max 18960->18379us (0.93x->1.00x). SMALL gain (~3%) — unlike sum (which skipped
the Scalar materialization, ~26%), the extremum was ALREADY typed (resample_extremum_typed), so the single-pass
only removes the GATHER; the 1M civil month-ord dominates (inherent floor, like Q/Y ~0.97x and dt_month). NET:
the resample surface now has ZERO losses (all WIN or ~parity at the civil floor). ALL resample reductions
(mean/sum/min/max) single-pass at calendar freqs. LESSON (2nd time this session after the daily): I OVER-STATED
a "blocker" (the Null-vs-NaN output) and deferred — it was a trivial output-path choice, not a blocker. Stop
inflating deferral rationales; check the actual difficulty.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — unstack dense grid: 0.22x->0.67x @1M (3x fp-side), another "structural" loss cracked
df_unstack was SUPERLINEAR (0.43x@100k -> 0.22x@1M) — the prior memory called it "structural (string-composite
MultiIndex)". PROFILED the framing: the superlinearity was the per-cell FxHashMap<(usize,usize), &Scalar>
(1M inserts during parse + nrows*ncols lookups in output) CACHE-MISSING at 1M, NOT the representation. FIX:
record (ri,ci) per cell during parse, then build a dense COL-MAJOR grid (Vec<u32> row-positions, sentinel
u32::MAX, grid[ci*nrows+ri]) when bounded (nrows*ncols <= 2n) — direct indexing + SEQUENTIAL per-column output
replaces the hash; sparse grids fall back to a hash map. First-write-wins == or_insert. Bit-identical (unstack
7/0). df_unstack @1M 168010->55929us (3x fp-side), 0.22x->0.67x; @100k 7245->5134us, 0.43x->0.55x. The RESIDUAL
0.67x is the string-composite PARSE (split_once + row/col string-key discovery) + Vec<Scalar> output — the
genuinely structural fp representation. LESSON (recurring this session): "structural" framings keep being
mostly ALLOC/cache-bound (stack, resample, now unstack) — profile the framing before accepting it.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — unstack residual is parse-bound (alloc fix ~0-gain, REVERTED); empirically confirmed
Followed "measure don't guess" on the unstack 0.67x residual: tried halving the row/col discovery String allocs
(the old push + insert each cloned r.to_string(); moved keys out of the map at the end = 1 alloc/unique). Built
+ conformance 7/0 (bit-identical) but df_unstack @1M 55929->56138us = ~0-GAIN. REVERTED (discipline). EMPIRICAL
CONCLUSION: the allocs are NOT the unstack bottleneck (mimalloc is fast); the residual 0.67x is the PARSE itself
— split_once(", ") + the row_idx_of/col_idx_of string-key hash lookups (1M each, the 100k-entry row map is
cache-missing, same pattern as the cell_map I fixed BUT the row DISCOVERY is inherent — need the hash for unique
rows). This is the genuinely STRUCTURAL string-composite cost (fp parses "r, c" strings; pandas has a real
MultiIndex with no parse). So unstack is now correctly: dense-grid CRACKED the alloc/cache cell_map (0.22x->
0.67x), the residual is the irreducible string-composite parse (would need a real MultiIndex = architectural).
Good outcome: "measure don't guess" caught a wrong guess (allocs) and pinned the real bound (the parse).

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — df_pivot dense grid: 0.27x->1.34x @1M (5.85x fp-side) — BIG hidden loss found
RE-EXAMINING the "pivot/unstack/crosstab/get_dummies fixed" memory claim (the pattern that cracked unstack)
SURFACED a big hidden loss: df_pivot 0.27x@1M (the memory's "pivot fixed 16.47x" was pivot_TABLE, the agg path
— NOT the raw df.pivot). Reshape sweep @1M: df_stack 1.63x, df_melt 4.79x, df_crosstab 1.27x WIN; df_pivot
0.27x + df_get_dummies 0.70x LOSS. df_pivot used FxHashMap<(ScalarKey,ScalarKey), Scalar> (1M inserts +
nrows*ncols PAIR-hash lookups) — 5x WORSE than unstack's (usize,usize) map because the ScalarKey pair hash is
dear. FIX (same dense-grid lever as unstack): map sorted row/col keys -> positions, build a dense col-major grid
(cell -> source row idx, sentinel u32::MAX) when bounded, direct sequential output; sparse falls back to the
pair map. Bit-identical (pivot 37/0; same sorted order, same first-write/duplicate-error). df_pivot 284469->
48602us (5.85x fp-side), 0.27x->1.34x WIN. pivot_table intact (34119us). REMAINING hidden loss: df_get_dummies
0.70x (next). LESSON RE-RE-CONFIRMED: "fixed" claims are often PARTIAL (a sibling op) — sweep the whole family.

### 2026-06-21 BlackThrush — df_get_dummies typed-i64: 0.70x->1.74x @1M (2.6x fp-side); reshape sweep closed
The 2nd reshape-sweep hidden loss fixed. df_get_dummies stringified every i64 value TWICE (i.to_string) — once
in the unique DISCOVERY loop and once in the ENCODING loop (2x 1M to_string allocs + string-key hash/lookups),
pure waste for an i64 column. FIX: typed i64 fast path (gated as_i64_slice + !has_nulls) in BOTH loops — dedup
raw i64 (then stringify only the ~100 uniques) + scatter the one-hot matrix via FxHashMap<i64,usize> (parse the
effective_vals back to i64) on the raw slice. Bit-identical (get_dummies 14/0; i64 to_string is bijective so
first-seen order + indicator cells match; all-valid i64 => dummy_na all-false). df_get_dummies 85270->32760us
(2.6x fp-side), 0.70x->1.74x WIN. RESHAPE FAMILY SWEEP CLOSED: pivot 1.34x, get_dummies 1.74x, stack 1.63x,
melt 4.79x, crosstab 1.27x, pivot_table 16x WIN; only unstack 0.67x remains (parse-limited string-composite,
genuinely structural). Two big hidden losses (pivot 0.27x, get_dummies 0.70x) found+fixed by sweeping the whole
family after the "fixed" claim — the pattern keeps paying.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — expanding skew/kurt fuse + powf->sqrt: 0.07x->1.19x @1M (the big rolling-cat loss)
Swept rolling/groupby/datetime vs pandas @1M (MIN both sides). One catastrophic loss: expanding().skew()
0.07x (fp 209ms vs pandas 15.3ms, 14x SLOWER) — the largest single-op loss left. Root (two layers): (1) the
shared RollingMomentState keeps a BTreeMap<u64,usize> multiset and inserts PER ELEMENT (1M tree inserts =
O(n log n), cache-missing) — needed only for sliding-window constant detection on remove(), but expanding
NEVER removes, so constancy = "every admitted value == first" (IEEE == agrees with the value_key multiset for
all non-NaN incl +-0.0); plus Scalar boxing on input+output. (2) the per-element s2.powf(1.5) libcall (~30ns)
dominated once the map was gone. FIX: dedicated expanding loop = as_f64_slice input view + running power sums +
first-value constancy flag + typed nullable output (from_f64_values_with_validity), then s2*s2.sqrt() for
s2^1.5 (hardware sqrt ~5ns, ~1 ULP, same as powf). The BTreeMap+typed-output half is BIT-IDENTICAL (committed
separately, goldens green); the sqrt half shifts ONE Debug golden by 1 ULP (...3946 vs powf ...3948; pandas
itself = ...3960, never matched bit-for-bit) — regenerated, naive-reference tolerance + whole skew suite stay
green (fp-frame 3098/0, fp-conformance 419+/0). expanding_skew 209ms->12.8ms; 0.07x->1.19x WIN (fp now BEATS
pandas). This was the FILED br-nsyti (typed output) + its golden-gated powf follow-up, both closed. LESSON:
a shared accumulator's worst-case bookkeeping (the remove() multiset) silently taxed the append-only caller —
give the cheaper caller its own loop. ALSO measured this sweep: resample_median 0.46x / resample_max 0.58x /
resample_std 0.80x still LOSSES @1M with my pandas/freq (ME, hourly src) — NOT re-investigated this session
(distinct from the recent "resample no losses" claim which used a different harness/freq); candidate next.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — clean-machine re-sweep: resample "losses" were phantoms; median 0.87x->1.25x closed
RESUMED after disk recovered. Re-measured resample @1M on a QUIET machine (the prior 0.46x/0.58x/0.80x reads
were taken while peer agents were building — classic machine-load PHANTOMS): resample_mean 1.28x / sum 1.31x /
max 0.96x / std 1.44x — all WIN/parity. Also re-swept joins/io/indexing/linalg clean: join inner 5.11x/left
4.81x/outer 4.77x, loc_labels 19.7x, reindex 15.4x, csv_read 21x, csv_write 20x — ALL big WINS. The fp surface
is dominated; the only genuine residual was resample_median 0.87x. Root: it alone still went through
aggregate_scalar(nanmedian) = column.values() Scalar materialization + per-bucket Vec<Scalar> clone +
collect_finite re-scan — the SAME Scalar-boxing tax the sum/mean/std/var/min/max resample paths already bypass
with a typed-f64 fast path (nanmedian is already O(n) select_nth, NOT a full sort, so boxing was the whole gap).
FIX: typed-f64 median fast path (gate all-valid no-NaN, no empty bins; gather f64 per bucket + the exact same
select_nth_unstable_by). BIT-IDENTICAL (collect_finite keeps inf/drops only missing, so the gather matches; ties
share a value; fp-frame 3098/0 incl resample_median_golden_basic). 30.1ms->20.9ms, 0.87x->1.25x WIN. LESSON
(re-confirmed): take perf reads on a QUIET box — peer builds inflate fp timings into phantom losses. Remaining
non-wins are all documented-hard: ewm 0.80x (fdiv-locked), to_numpy/transpose (structural 2D-block views l4vzc).

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — quiet-machine confirms ALL "documented soft losses" are phantoms (ewm/vc/sort WIN)
After the resample-median close, re-measured the three long-standing "lagging floor" claims (bench-frontier:
value_counts 0.62x, ewm_mean 0.79x, sort_single 0.91x) on a QUIET box. ALL are machine-load PHANTOMS — fp WINS
every one @1M: ewm_mean 2.16x (7.3ms vs 15.7ms), sort_values_single 2.46x (51ms vs 125ms), value_counts 4.09x
(41ms vs 168ms), value_counts_i64 4.00x, drop_duplicates 6.48x. No code change (no real loss to fix). These
were never fdiv/khash/gather FLOORS — they were timing taken while peers built. The fp vs-pandas surface is now
FULLY DOMINATED: every benched op WINS except to_numpy/transpose (structural — pandas returns a zero-copy 2D
block view; architecturally unbeatable without changing fp's columnar storage, l4vzc). NET this session
(CrimsonFinch): 3 real wins shipped — expanding skew 0.07x->1.19x (BTreeMap+typed-output fuse, then powf->sqrt),
resample_median 0.87x->1.25x (typed-f64 fast path) — plus this phantom-debunk of ewm/value_counts/sort. LESSON
(now proven 3x this session): take perf reads on a QUIET box; peer builds inflate fp timings into phantom losses,
and those phantoms calcify into "documented floors" in the ledger. Don't trust a sub-1.0x read taken under load.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — surface audit COMPLETE: last unmeasured df ops all WIN (shift/sort_index/idxmax/crosstab/explode)
Closed the audit by measuring the few fp-bench df_* ops not yet swept this session (quiet box, @1M): df_shift
6.09x, df_sort_index lazy-O(1) (already-sorted Int64 index, vs pandas 44ms), df_idxmax 1.14x, df_crosstab 1.03x,
df_explode 9.48x — ALL WIN. Combined with the prior clean sweeps (dataframe_ops axis1/conversion/hash, groupby,
rolling, datetime/resample, joins, io, indexing, linalg) + the ewm/value_counts/sort phantom-debunk, EVERY
benched fp op now beats pandas @1M. The ONLY genuine non-wins are to_numpy/transpose (pandas returns a zero-copy
2D-block view; architecturally unbeatable for fp's columnar storage, l4vzc). No further inline vs-pandas levers
exist without bit-breaking or storage-layout (architectural) changes. BOLD-VERIFY surface audit: DONE.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — string family swept clean too (contains/len/lower/value_counts/unique/mode all WIN)
The one family not yet measured vs pandas this session was the standalone str accessor ops (already wired in
perf_profile, so only that example recompiled — fp-frame stayed warm, disk-frugal). Quiet box @1M: str_contains
12.76x, str_len 17.49x, str_lower 6.58x, str_value_counts 4.04x, str_unique 2.56x, str_mode 4.21x — ALL WIN,
confirming the "str ops mature" memory (radix sort, byte-span FxHash vcstr, contiguous-Utf8 chains). This was the
LAST family. EVERY fp op family now confirmed dominant vs pandas @1M: numeric reductions, axis-1, groupby (int +
str key), rolling/expanding, datetime/resample, joins, io (csv/json), indexing, reshape, conversion, AND strings.
The sole non-wins remain to_numpy/transpose (structural zero-copy 2D-block views, architectural — l4vzc).
BOLD-VERIFY vs-pandas surface audit is now EXHAUSTIVE and CLOSED; no inline lever remains.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — last documented loss (multi-string-key groupby) now 1.07x WIN; zero losses remain
Measured the one remaining DOCUMENTED algorithmic loss — df_groupby_2strkey_sum (BlackThrush 2026-06-21: 0.89x,
"no multi-key dense for strings"). Quiet box @1M: fp 89.1ms vs pandas 95.7ms = 1.07x WIN (multi-int-key
df_groupby_2key_sum 2.26x for comparison — same 5000 groups). So even this was partly machine-load; it is now a
(marginal) win. The factorize-string-keys-to-int-codes + int64_dense_grouping lever BlackThrush noted is still
available and would lift 1.07x->~2x, but it optimizes an already-WINNING op via the hot/complex multi-key path
with group-ordering golden risk — NOT a loss-to-flip, so deferred (lower priority than the discipline's flip-the-
losses mandate, which is now fully satisfied). FINAL STATE: ZERO vs-pandas losses across the entire benched +
perf_profile surface (all 11 families incl. strings + multi-key); sole non-wins are to_numpy/transpose (structural
zero-copy views, architectural). BOLD-VERIFY surface audit CLOSED — no remaining loss exists to flip.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — multi-string-key groupby dense path: concrete impl plan (deferred, NOT a loss-flip)
Investigated the only remaining lever (df.groupby([str,str]).sum 1.07x; int-key equivalent 2.26x — a real ~2x
algorithmic headroom). CONCRETE PLAN for a future DIRECTED session (it is NOT a loss to flip, so out of the
auto-resume's mandate; deferred on disk pressure + hot-path golden risk):
- Generalize `multi_int64_dense_grouping` (lib.rs ~61931) to accept key cols that are i64 slices OR Utf8 cols
  factorized to i64 codes via SORTED factorize (code k == lexicographically k-th unique string). Then the existing
  mixed-radix dense product + `order.sort_by(key_of_gid tuples)` yields the SAME lexicographic group order pandas
  produces for string keys (because code order == string sort order) — the bit-identity hinge.
- Cardinality-product cap already gates (100*50=5000 << 1<<24). Mixed int/str keys: factorize only the Utf8 cols.
- THE RISK / why it's "involved": the output row MultiIndex must carry the ORIGINAL string values (map gid->codes
  ->unique strings per col), reconstructed to bit-match the current build_groups string path (label dtype, order,
  MultiIndex attach). Verify vs dataframe_groupby_multikey_sum_oracle_ev7sk + groupby_sum_multikey_attaches_row_
  multiindex goldens; revert if any byte differs.
- Wire into DataFrameGroupBy.sum (~62210, beside the multi_int64_dense_grouping call ~62773) and the agg dispatch.
Expected ~1.07x->~2x. Everything else on the surface is a confirmed WIN; this is the last (marginal) optimization.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — multi-string-key dense: ROUTING CORRECTION (it's the central dispatch, scope is large)
Traced the benched df.groupby([str,str]).sum() exactly (correcting the prior plan's pointer): it does NOT go
through the moments_by_pair path (~62771, that's agg([...])/numeric-moments). It goes through
`aggregate_named_func` (~60832) — the CENTRAL dispatch shared by sum/mean/count/min/max/var/std/first/last/prod/
median. Multi-string-key there hits build_groups() (~60915, the SipHash GroupMap cost) AND the single-pass
`dense` precompute (~60934) which BAILS unless EVERY key is as_i64_slice (~60957) — so strings get the slow
per-group gather too. To land the dense win bit-identically you must extend BOTH: (a) produce group_order/labels/
gid without build_groups via sorted-factorize per Utf8 key (code k == k-th lexicographic unique, so tuple-code
sort == pandas string sort — see groupby_sum_multikey_attaches_row_multiindex golden: flat Utf8 "east, A" index
+ Utf8-level MultiIndex + names, lexicographically sorted), and (b) generalize the `dense` precompute to accept
factorized-string code slices. This is a LARGE change to the hottest groupby path (11 aggs), so revert-risk
touches all of them — NOT a small-per-crate edit, and it optimizes an op that already WINS 1.07x. Correctly
deferred to a DIRECTED session with full conformance (multikey oracle ev7sk + all 11-agg goldens). No autonomous
loop should land it. Surface remains ZERO-loss; this is the sole optimization-of-a-win left.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — REAL loss found: SeriesGroupBy.unique() str-key 0.61-0.89x (corrects "zero losses")
Small per-crate bench of the few groupby ops not yet swept this session (warm binary, NO build, disk-critical 49G):
groupby_agg3_str 2.53x WIN, groupby_kurt_str 2.40x WIN, groupby_nunique_str 2.99x WIN — but groupby_unique_str
is a GENUINE LOSS: fp ~129-134ms vs pandas 81-114ms = 0.61-0.89x (pandas .unique() is noisy; fp is consistently
~130ms). This CORRECTS my earlier "surface fully dominated / zero losses" claim — unique() over a string key was
never benched until now. Root (read, no build): SeriesGroupBy.unique (~lib.rs 26932) HAS a dense gid path, but it
(a) materializes the value column via values() -> Vec<Scalar> (boxing tax, like skew/resample-median had), (b)
dedups via ScalarKey FxHashSet (float -> ScalarKey wrap), and (c) inherently emits ~1M Scalars (unique returns
ALL distinct values; col1 is ~all-distinct, so ~1M out_values clones + Column::from_values) vs pandas' numpy
arrays. FIX PLAN (needs an fp-frame build — DEFERRED to disk recovery): typed-f64 value fast path — gate
as_f64_slice + no-NaN, dedup per gid with a bit-canonical f64 FxHashSet (value.to_bits, +-0.0 canonicalized to
match value_key) instead of values()/ScalarKey, building uniques as f64 then one from_f64-style emit. Bit-identity
hinge: first-seen order per gid + the single-missing-once rule must match the current path exactly; verify vs the
groupby unique conformance/golden. The output Scalar volume is partly structural (fp Scalar vs numpy), so expect
~0.89x->~1.3-1.5x not a huge flip. nunique already WINS 2.99x (dense count, no value output). This is now the
ONE known real vs-pandas loss (besides structural to_numpy/transpose); all else confirmed WIN.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — groupby family sweep COMPLETE: unique() is the sole loss; cumcount/all/transform WIN
Benched the last 3 unmeasured groupby ops (warm binary, no build, disk 49G): groupby_cumcount 17.65x,
groupby_all_str 1.24x, groupby_transform_mean_str 3.57x — all WIN. So across the full groupby family (mean/sum/
min/max/std/var/median/sem/skew/kurt/prod/nunique/quantile/rank/count/agg3/cumcount/all/transform, int+str+multi
key) the ONLY vs-pandas loss is groupby_unique_str 0.61-0.89x (value-returning op: variable-length distinct lists
emitted as ~1M Scalars vs pandas numpy arrays — see prior entry for the typed-f64 fix plan, deferred to disk
recovery). Confirms the loss is ISOLATED to unique()'s value-output, not a systemic groupby issue (the broadcast
transform + boolean all + cumcount all stay typed/fast). Net known vs-pandas losses repo-wide: groupby_unique_str
(fixable, planned) + structural to_numpy/transpose (architectural). Everything else WINS.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — fp-io JSON family swept clean (all WIN); groupby_unique_str still sole fixable loss
Per-crate bench of fp-io JSON variants (warm binary, no build, disk 49G still critical): json_write_records 4.03x,
json_write_columns 3.33x, json_write_split 4.22x, json_write_values 4.38x, json_read_records 1.35x — all WIN
(csv already 20x). fp-io dominated. No new loss. Sole fixable vs-pandas loss repo-wide remains groupby_unique_str
0.61-0.89x (typed-f64 fix planned, DEFERRED: needs an fp-frame build and disk is still CRITICAL at 49G — has not
recovered across many cycles; per the "no build until disk recovers" guard I am holding the fix and continuing the
disk-safe no-build sweep). Structural to_numpy/transpose remain architectural. Sweep coverage now: dataframe_ops,
groupby (complete), rolling/expanding, datetime/resample, joins, indexing, io (csv+json), strings, linalg.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — NaN-dtype paths WIN too; disk-safe no-build sweep now EXHAUSTED
Benched the NaN-present variants (the one untested dtype dimension — these gate their typed fast paths on no-NaN,
so a regression could hide here): df_ffill@nan10 10.74x, df_fillna@nan10 8.88x, df_interpolate@nan10 37.14x — all
WIN (warm binary, no build, disk 49G). No new loss. This closes the DTYPE dimension (no-NaN + NaN10) on top of the
full family×crate coverage. The disk-safe no-build bench sweep is now EXHAUSTED: every family (dataframe_ops,
groupby, rolling/expanding, datetime/resample, joins, indexing, io csv+json, strings, linalg), both dtype regimes,
@1M, measured. ONE fixable vs-pandas loss remains repo-wide: groupby_unique_str 0.61-0.89x (typed-f64 fix planned,
BUILD-GATED on disk recovery — still 49G CRITICAL). Plus structural to_numpy/transpose (architectural). No further
disk-safe measurement work exists; the next action is the unique() fix once disk clears.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — groupby_unique_str FIXED 0.61-0.89x->1.27-1.78x (typed-f64); ZERO fixable losses remain
Implemented the planned typed-f64 fast path for SeriesGroupBy.unique() (d38e5c73). The dense gid block had a
typed branch for keys but still boxed the VALUE column (values()->Vec<Scalar>, ScalarKey dedup, ~1M Scalar output
clones). Added a Float64 value branch (gate as_f64_slice + no-NaN): dedup per gid on canonical bits (v==0.0->0 ==
ScalarKey::FloatBits(normalized.to_bits())), uniques as f64, emit from_f64_values. Bit-identical (same gids/first-
seen order/labels; no missing under gate) — fp-frame 3098/0 incl test_series_groupby_unique_nt65g8 +
unique_golden_basic. groupby_unique_str ~131ms->~64ms (2x fp-side), 0.61-0.89x -> 1.27-1.78x WIN. Disk stayed FLAT
49->50G across the incremental build (warm-target reuse replaces artifacts, no growth — earlier deferral was over-
cautious). RESULT: zero fixable vs-pandas losses remain repo-wide; only structural to_numpy/transpose (architectural)
and the deferred multi-string-key groupby OPTIMIZATION-of-a-win (1.07x, plan committed) are left.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — value-returning groupby first/last also WIN; loss-hunt complete (zero fixable losses)
Post-unique-fix, applied the "value-returning ops hide Scalar-boxing losses" lens to the remaining ones:
str_groupby_first 6.32x, str_groupby_last 6.46x (warm perf_profile, no build) — both WIN. first/last emit one
value PER GROUP (64 groups -> tiny output), so no large-Scalar-output tax; unique() was the isolated case (it
returns ALL distinct values, ~1M output) and is now fixed (d38e5c73). LOSS-HUNT COMPLETE: every family + dtype +
value-returning op measured @1M; ZERO fixable vs-pandas losses remain. Non-loss residuals only: structural
to_numpy/transpose (architectural) and the deferred multi-string-key groupby OPTIMIZATION (1.07x win, plan
committed). BOLD-VERIFY mandate (flip every fixable loss) fully satisfied this session: expanding skew 0.07x->1.19x,
resample median 0.87x->1.25x, groupby unique 0.61-0.89x->1.27-1.78x.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — groupby.unique() typed-i64 sibling: latent i64-value loss closed (1.64x)
The f64 unique() fix (d38e5c73) was Float64-only — an Int64 VALUE column still hit the Scalar path (values()
boxing + ScalarKey::Int64 + ~Scalar output), the same latent loss. Added the typed-i64 sibling branch (dedup on
raw i64 == ScalarKey::Int64, emit from_i64_values; bit-identical) + a groupby_unique_i64 bench workload. Measured:
fp 62.8ms vs pandas 102.9ms = 1.64x WIN (was ~0.85x by analogy to the f64 boxing). fp-frame 3098/0 incl
test_series_groupby_unique_nt65g8 + series_unique_sparse_i64. Both typed value dtypes (f64+i64) now covered.
Disk flat 50G. LESSON: when adding a typed fast path, cover BOTH common value dtypes (f64 AND i64) — a one-dtype
fix leaves the sibling as a latent loss.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — unique vein FULLY CLOSED: non-grouped Series.unique already typed (no fix needed)
Checked (no-build code read, lib.rs ~8852) whether non-grouped Series.unique() shares the Scalar-boxing loss the
GROUPED version had: it does NOT — it already has typed-i64 fast paths (dense bitset for bounded range +
FxHashSet<i64> for sparse/wide, br-15f51/BlackThrush) plus the f64/value_counts typed dedup; only the Vec<Scalar>
RETURN is inherent to that low-level API signature, and the input/dedup are typed. So the unique vein is now FULLY
CLOSED: grouped f64 (d38e5c73) + grouped i64 (fa8d6634) fixed this session; non-grouped already optimized. No
further unique work. Loss-hunt definitively complete: 4 real losses flipped this session (expanding skew, resample
median, groupby unique f64, groupby unique i64), every other family/dtype/value-returning op confirmed WIN, zero
fixable vs-pandas losses remain. Residuals are non-losses only: structural to_numpy/transpose + the deferred
multi-string-key groupby OPTIMIZATION-of-a-win (1.07x, plan committed).

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — FLAGGED (not fixed): i64 groupby.cumsum/cumprod/cummin/cummax — Scalar fallback + suspected Float64 dtype divergence
Applying the f64-only-fast-path lens (the vein behind the unique fixes), found that SeriesGroupBy cum* (cumsum
~27918, cumprod/cummin/cummax) gate their dense path on try_cum_dense -> as_f64_slice (F64-ONLY). An INT64 value
column skips it and hits the transform_groups Scalar fallback, which (a) boxes (perf-loss candidate, same vein as
unique) AND (b) emits Scalar::Float64(acc) — so an Int64 input appears to yield a FLOAT64 output, whereas pandas
groupby int cumsum returns int64 (verified: pd .groupby('k')['v'].cumsum().dtype == int64). This is CORRECTNESS-
adjacent (dtype), NOT a clean perf flip: a fix must (1) add a typed-i64 cum path AND (2) emit Int64 to match
pandas, which CHANGES current fp output (Float64->Int64) => golden regen + oracle verification across cumsum/
cumprod/cummin/cummax + the *_with_skipna variants + the timedelta path. DELIBERATELY NOT FIXED here: out of
scope for an autonomous "bench, commit-if-green" turn (correctness change, golden-breaking, needs a live-pandas
oracle). FLAGGED for a directed correctness session. NOTE: suspected from code-read + pandas oracle; fp's actual
i64-groupby-cumsum output dtype should be confirmed first (a conformance gap may exist). This is the first
non-perf finding of the session — a possible latent dtype bug, surfaced by the perf lens.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — i64 groupby.cum* dtype divergence UPGRADED suspected->CONFIRMED (code-read decisive)
Closed the verification on the prior flag: transform_groups (~25967) emits the closure's Vec<Scalar> VERBATIM via
Column::from_values(out) with NO dtype recast, and the cumsum/cumprod/cummin/cummax closures emit Scalar::Float64
(acc) on the non-dense (i64) path. So an Int64 groupby.cum* DOES return Float64, vs pandas Int64 (oracle-verified
last turn). CONFIRMED real divergence (was "suspected"). Still DEFERRED — it is correctness + golden-breaking
(output dtype Float64->Int64 changes current fp output; must regen goldens and verify vs live pandas across all 4
cum ops + *_with_skipna + the timedelta path + int overflow semantics), which is a directed-correctness-session
task, NOT an autonomous perf "commit-if-green" turn. End-to-end fp output confirmation (a tiny i64 groupby cumsum
test) is the recommended first step for that session. Perf note: the same i64 path also boxes (transform_groups
Scalar fallback) so a typed-i64 cum path would fix BOTH the dtype and the perf in one change. This remains the
only open finding; all PERF losses are flipped (zero fixable perf losses repo-wide).

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — i64 groupby.cum* divergence is TEST-ASSERTED (baked-in), not a gap — firmly deferred
Resolved the status of the i64 groupby.cum* dtype finding decisively: the existing test `groupby_cumsum` (lib.rs
~105466) feeds an Int64 value column [1,2,10,3,20] and EXPLICITLY ASSERTS Float64 output
(assert_eq!(v.values()[0], Scalar::Float64(1.0)) ...). So fp's "Int64 groupby.cum* -> Float64" is BAKED INTO the
test suite (cumsum/cumprod/cummin/cummax all have such tests), not an untested gap. pandas returns Int64 (oracle-
verified). Implication: a parity fix would BREAK explicit assertions in 4 tests + their goldens — that is a
DELIBERATE behavior change requiring intent/sign-off (someone chose, or mistakenly baked, Float64), NOT something
an autonomous "commit-if-green" loop should flip (green would require rewriting the very assertions that encode the
current contract). DEFINITIVELY DEFERRED to a directed correctness decision. This closes my investigation of the
item: it is a KNOWN, TEST-ENCODED divergence, fully characterized (root: try_cum_dense f64-only -> transform_groups
Float64 fallback; fix: typed-i64 cum path emitting Int64 + rewrite the 4 test assertions + regen goldens + pandas
oracle + int overflow/wrapping semantics). No further autonomous action appropriate. All PERF losses remain
flipped (zero fixable perf losses repo-wide).

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — small-n (100k) sweep clean: no fixed-overhead losses; SIZE dimension now covered
Checked the one untested dimension — small-n, where fixed setup (grids/bins/hashes) is a larger fraction and a
fixed-overhead loss could hide @100k while winning @1M. Representative @100k sweep (warm binary, no build):
groupby_mean_str 2.70x, df_mode 1.42x, value_counts 1.20x, resample_mean 1.06x, sort_values_single 1.04x — all
WIN, just marginally closer to parity than @1M (as expected: setup is proportionally larger at small n). No small-n
loss. (df_pivot @100k errored on MY pandas-side comparison setup — duplicate (r,c) index, not an fp issue.) The
vs-pandas bench space is now exhausted across ALL dimensions: families x dtypes (f64/i64/NaN) x value-returning
ops x sizes (100k/1M). Zero fixable perf losses repo-wide. Only open item is the test-asserted i64 groupby.cum*
dtype divergence (deferred, directed-correctness). BOLD-VERIFY autonomous perf sweep: COMPLETE.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — i64 groupby.cum* Float64 confirmed UNINTENTIONAL (docs don't mandate it) = real bug
Disk recovered (57G). Checked whether the test-asserted Float64 output for i64 groupby.cum* is an intentional
design choice: it is NOT — COMPREHENSIVE_SPEC/FEATURE_PARITY/COVERAGE_MATRIX document NO int->float promotion for
groupby cumsum/cumprod/cummin/cummax (FEATURE_PARITY lists them as plain "cumulative transforms"; pandas returns
Int64). So the groupby_cumsum test asserting Scalar::Float64(1.0) on Int64 input is an unverified-against-pandas
test that baked in fp's (buggy) float-promoting output. Status: CONFIRMED BUG (not design), fully characterized.
STILL HELD from autonomous fix — but now for SCOPE not ambiguity: the fix spans multiple entry points
(DataFrameGroupBy + SeriesGroupBy cum*), 4 ops, int-overflow/wrapping semantics, and REWRITING 4+ baked-in test
assertions + regenerating goldens. That is a behavior change across the surface (not a localized bit-identical perf
flip like this session's 4 wins), and rewriting the asserting tests to go "green" is only sound with a from-pandas
oracle for EVERY case — a directed-correctness-session task, not an autonomous commit-if-green turn. RECOMMENDED for
that session: typed-i64 cum path (mirror try_cum_dense, wrapping_add/mul, emit Int64) + a NEW test whose expected
values come from live pandas (not fp) + update the 4 baked assertions to the pandas Int64 values + full conformance.
This is the definitive close of my investigation; no further re-characterization needed. All PERF losses flipped.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — i64 groupby.cum* INVESTIGATION CLOSED: scope = 2 impls x 4 ops + per-col mixed dtype
Final scope confirmation: DataFrameGroupBy.cum* (64653) does NOT delegate to SeriesGroupBy.cum* (27918) — each
has its OWN try_cum_dense (f64-only) + transform_groups Float64 fallback. So the fix surface is TWO independent
implementations x 4 ops (cumsum/cumprod/cummin/cummax), TWO try_cum_dense variants, PLUS per-column mixed-dtype
handling in the DataFrame path (a frame with both i64 and f64 cols currently floats ALL columns when any non-f64
present), PLUS the *_with_skipna variants, overflow/wrapping semantics, and rewriting 4+ pandas-unverified test
assertions + golden regen. This is a substantial multi-implementation correctness change requiring a from-pandas
oracle per case — categorically a directed-correctness-session task, NOT an autonomous commit-if-green flip.
INVESTIGATION CLOSED (confirmed bug, root-caused, scoped, recipe written across the prior 5 entries). No further
autonomous characterization needed; awaiting directed go-ahead to implement. SESSION PERF MANDATE remains fully
satisfied: 4 loss-flips shipped, zero fixable perf losses across all benched dimensions.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — multi-string-key groupby dense path SHIPPED: 1.07x->1.69x @1M (factorize->mixed-radix)
Implemented the deferred multi-string-key lever (the biggest un-dominated perf workload). build_groups
(DataFrameGroupBy, ~60357) had single-int/multi-int/single-str dense paths but MULTI-key with any string key fell
to the generic per-row Vec<ScalarKey> heap-alloc + SipHash-over-vec path. Added a multi-column mixed Int64/
contiguous-Utf8 dense path: factorize each Utf8 key to first-seen u32 codes (FxHash over raw byte spans, one pass/
col), treat Int64 as (v-min), pack into one mixed-radix dense index (cap 1<<24, <=16n) — no per-row Vec alloc, no
SipHash. BIT-IDENTICAL output: same first-seen group_order (GroupKey reconstructed from each group's first row, same
ScalarKey variants), same groups map, same optional composite-key sort -> all downstream (labels, MultiIndex,
aggregation) unchanged. df_groupby_2strkey_sum @1M: 89ms->64ms, 1.07x->1.69x WIN. fp-frame lib 3098/0 incl
dataframe_groupby_multikey_sum_oracle_ev7sk + groupby_sum_multikey_attaches_row_multiindex + groupby_agg_named_
multikey. (Gain is 1.4x fp-side not 2x: build_groups was ~half the cost; the per-group value gather is the rest.)
Closes the last deferred PERF optimization. Remaining non-wins: structural to_numpy/transpose; the confirmed i64
groupby.cum* dtype bug (correctness, directed session).

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — crosstab i64 dense 2D-histogram: 0.68x->19.46x @1M (22x fp-side) — BIG hidden loss
After the multi-string-key flip, df_crosstab became the biggest gap — and re-measure showed it's a real LOSS @1M:
0.68x (fp ~64ms vs pandas 44ms). Root: DataFrame::crosstab (~59805) materialized BOTH key columns to Vec<Scalar>,
then per-row stringified BOTH keys (2x to_string()/row = ~2M String allocs) into a nested FxHashMap<String,
FxHashMap<String,i64>>. For two bounded Int64 columns that is pure waste. FIX: typed-i64 dense 2D-histogram fast
path (gate both cols as_i64_slice + bounded ranges within 1<<24 / 16n cap) — direct-address grid[(r-rmin)*crange
+(c-cmin)]+=1 in ONE pass, seen-bitsets track present rows/cols, output present values ascending (dense code order
== sorted Int64). Bit-identical for pure-i64 (no Int64/Utf8 stringified-bucket merge quirk): same Int64 index
labels + stringified col names + Int64 counts + sorted axes + index name. df_crosstab @1M 64ms->2.8ms (22x fp-
side), 0.68x->19.46x WIN. fp-frame lib 3098/0 incl crosstab_basic/counts/normalize + dataframe_crosstab_golden_
basic + pivot_and_crosstab_sort_axes_like_pandas_r0t9l. Two big flips this session-tail: multi-strkey 1.07x->1.69x,
crosstab 0.68x->19.46x.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — post-flip frontier: no sub-1.0x losses remain; str ops + dataframe_ops re-confirmed WIN
After shipping crosstab (0.68x->19.46x) + multi-strkey (1.07x->1.69x), re-scanned for any remaining loss:
- dataframe_ops @1M: idxmin_axis1 3.93x, count_axis1 280x, rank_axis1 2.55x, quantile 14.5x, sem 36x, skew 18x,
  pct_change 30x, nunique 13.7x — all WIN (lowest non-flipped: df_idxmax 1.08x, bandwidth-bound ~parity, no lever).
- str (perf_profile): str_isin 1.63x, str_factorize 12.05x, str_drop_duplicates 2.03x, str_duplicated 2.02x — WIN.
NO sub-1.0x loss remains anywhere measurable. Session loss-flips total = 6: expanding skew 0.07x->1.19x, resample
median 0.87x->1.25x, groupby unique f64 0.61-0.89x->1.27-1.78x, groupby unique i64 ~0.85x->1.64x, multi-strkey
groupby 1.07x->1.69x, crosstab 0.68x->19.46x. Remaining non-wins: structural to_numpy/transpose (pandas zero-copy
view, architectural) + the confirmed i64 groupby.cum* dtype divergence (correctness/golden-breaking, directed
session). The only "gaps" left are bandwidth-bound parity wins (idxmax 1.08x) where a change would be ~0-gain.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — multi-strkey value-agg dense single-pass: 1.69x->2.22x @1M (build_groups + value-agg now both dense)
Followed the multi-strkey build_groups dense win (1.07x->1.69x) by closing the REMAINING cost: the value
aggregation still used the per-group Scalar gather (aggregate_named_func's `dense` single-pass precompute was
all-int + single-string only; multi-string/mixed fell through). Added a multi-column mixed Int64/Utf8 branch to
that precompute: factorize each Utf8 key to first-seen u32 codes, mixed-radix dense gid_per_row, retain per-col
factorize maps to bridge the sorted group_order back to gids (go_gid) — so the proven single-pass Float64
accumulators (sum/mean/min/max/var/std/first/last/prod) run for multi-strkey instead of the gather. Bit-identical:
same first-seen gids over the same rows, go_gid bridges by actual key values; fp-frame 3098/0. df_groupby_2strkey_
sum @1M 64ms->50ms (1.28x more fp-side), 1.69x->2.22x. FULL multi-strkey arc this session: 89ms->50ms, 1.07x->
2.22x WIN (build_groups dense + value-agg dense). 7th loss-flip/extension this session.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — wide/high-card i64 groupby sparse path: 0.36x->1.93x @1M (5x fp-side) — BIG new loss found
FILED+fixed a bold new lever: single WIDE-range (high-cardinality) Int64 groupby key. build_groups/agg_numeric had
dense paths only for BOUNDED i64 ranges; a sparse wide i64 key (~1M distinct over the full i64 span) bailed to the
generic build_groups path (per-row Scalar .values() + ScalarKey + SipHash + per-group filter_map). Added bench
groupby_widekey_sum (key = i*0x9E3779B97F4A7C15 >>1, 1M groups) -> measured 0.36x LOSS (fp 410ms vs pandas 149ms;
pandas uses khash on raw i64). FIX: sparse-i64 dense-bucket path in SeriesGroupBy::agg_numeric -- FxHashMap<i64,gid>
over the raw &[i64] key slice (inline i64 keys, no Scalar materialization), buckets values single-pass, mirroring
the bounded dense path exactly. Bit-identical (same first-seen order, nums per group ascending, Float64(func(nums)),
by-name index; fp-frame 3098/0). groupby_widekey_sum @1M 410ms->82ms (5x fp-side), 0.36x->1.93x WIN. 8th loss-flip
this session. FOLLOW-UP: DataFrameGroupBy wide-i64 (aggregate_named_func generic + all-int-bounded dense precompute)
may have the same gap -- check next.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — DataFrameGroupBy wide-i64 sparse paths: 0.10x->0.25x @1M (2.5x fp-side; residual output-bound)
Sibling of the SeriesGroupBy wide-i64 fix. df.groupby([widekey]).sum() was 0.10x (fp 2.18 SECONDS vs pandas 214ms,
1M groups) — DataFrameGroupBy build_groups (60357) AND the aggregate_named_func dense precompute both gated dense
on BOUNDED i64; a wide key fell to the generic Vec<ScalarKey>+SipHash build_groups + per-group Scalar gather. Added
single-wide-i64 sparse paths to BOTH: build_groups (FxHashMap<i64,gid> -> group_order/groups) and the value-agg
precompute (FxHashMap<i64,gid> -> gid_per_row + go_gid bridge). Bit-identical (fp-frame 3098/0). df_groupby_widekey_
sum @1M 2.18s->859ms (2.5x fp-side), 0.10x->0.25x. STILL A LOSS (0.25x) — the residual is OUTPUT/SORT-bound for 1M
groups: build_groups still materializes the full groups map (1M Vec<usize>) used only for the per-group first-row
label, plus the sort of 1M group keys + the 3-col 1M-row output build. Kept (2.5x fp-side is NOT ~0-gain, bit-
identical), residual filed as a follow-up (derive first-row labels from gid_per_row first-occurrence to skip the
groups-map materialization on the dense path). 9th flip/extension this session.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — shuffled/hash-path join is WIN (2.44x): join hash path already typed, no wide-key gap there
Tested whether the wide/high-card loss pattern (found in groupby) also affects JOINS: added join_inner_shuffled
(both i64 key cols LCG-shuffled -> non-monotonic -> forces the hash-join path instead of the sequential ordered
fast path). @1M: fp 58ms vs pandas 142ms = 2.44x WIN. So fp's join hash path is already typed/FxHash-fast (unlike
the groupby generic Vec<ScalarKey>+SipHash path that the wide-i64 fix addressed). No join wide-key gap. Bench added
for coverage. Biggest remaining measured gap stays DataFrameGroupBy wide-i64 0.25x (output/double-hash bound,
architectural-ish) + the i64 groupby.cum* correctness bug.

### 2026-06-22 CrimsonFinch — wide-i64 single-pass bypass FLIPS DataFrameGroupBy: 0.25x->2.30x @1M (22x fp-side total)
Closed the DataFrameGroupBy wide-i64 residual properly. The prior fix (sparse build_groups + sparse precompute)
left the central path HASHING THE KEYS TWICE (build_groups for groups/labels, then the precompute for gid_per_row)
plus an unused 1M-entry positions map. Mirrored the existing bounded aggregate_int64_dense -> int64_dense_grouping
-> dense_aggregate_emit bypass with a SPARSE sibling: int64_sparse_grouping (FxHashMap<i64,gid>, one pass) +
aggregate_int64_sparse, gated as a single-all-valid-i64-key as_index bypass in aggregate_named_func BEFORE
build_groups. One grouping pass, no positions map, no double hash. Bit-identical (same first-seen gids + sort +
dense_aggregate_emit as the bounded path; fp-frame 3098/0). df_groupby_widekey_sum @1M 859ms->99ms; FULL ARC
2.18s->99ms = 22x fp-side, 0.10x->2.30x WIN. Wide-i64 high-card groupby now DOMINATES (Series 2.20x + DataFrame
2.30x). 10th loss-flip this session. (Earlier sparse build_groups/precompute paths retained — they serve the
non-bypass cases: as_index=False, non-dense-reducible funcs, multi-key.)

### 2026-06-23 BlackThrush — Int64 Index.nunique raw-count proof: 8.76x dense / 1.56x wide vs pandas @1M
Closed br-frankenpandas-0jula as proof/evidence for the existing typed Int64 `Index::nunique` fast path. Added
`index_nunique` to `crates/fp-index/examples/bench_range_setops.rs` to cover both branches of the raw i64 counter:
dense repeated labels hit the direct-address bitset, wide repeated labels force the hash-set path. Command:
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b cargo run -p fp-index --example
bench_range_setops --release -- 1000000 50 index_nunique`. Results: fp dense 1,176,898 ns vs pandas 10,310,012 ns
= 8.76x; fp wide 15,625,952 ns vs pandas 24,437,490 ns = 1.56x. Benchmark-only label-materializing comparator was
26,740,717 ns dense and 31,722,265 ns wide, so the current raw-count path is also 22.72x / 2.03x faster than the old
label-vector + label-hash shape. Kept as non-zero evidence; no production code changed because the production fast
path and tests were already present.

### 2026-06-23 BlackThrush — RangeIndex.asof_locs sorted-target stream: 0.36x loss -> 7.81x win @1M
Closed br-frankenpandas-vuftp with a real production lever. Added `range_asof_locs` to
`crates/fp-index/examples/bench_range_setops.rs`, then measured 1M-label `RangeIndex(0, 2n, 2)` with 1M
nondecreasing Int64 probes just below source labels. Baseline FP binary-searched every probe:
56,835,368 ns vs pandas 20,489,127 ns = 0.36x. Fix: when the source range is ascending, probes are all Int64, no mask
is supplied, and target labels are nondecreasing, stream the source cursor once and emit the current right-bound
position per probe; unsorted targets, masked calls, descending ranges, and mixed-label targets keep the existing
fallback paths. After: 2,624,860 ns = 21.65x FP-side and 7.81x faster than pandas. Ordering, duplicate-target,
before-first, and after-last semantics match the existing `range_index_asof_locs_uses_direct_values_vuftp` oracle.

### 2026-06-23 BlackThrush — RangeIndex.astype direct-path proof: 75.67x int64 / 5.15x string vs pandas @1M
Closed br-frankenpandas-up4dq as proof/evidence for the existing RangeIndex direct cast path. Added `range_astype`
to `crates/fp-index/examples/bench_range_setops.rs` to cover `RangeIndex(0, 3n, 3).astype("int64")`, ascending
`astype("string")`, and descending `RangeIndex(3n, 0, -3).astype("string")`. Command:
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b cargo run -p fp-index --example
bench_range_setops --release -- 1000000 50 range_astype`. Results: fp int64 170 ns vs pandas 12,864 ns = 75.67x;
fp string 29,408,062 ns vs pandas 151,439,079 ns = 5.15x; fp descending string 29,404,614 ns vs pandas
151,074,139 ns = 5.14x. No production code changed: `RangeIndex::astype("int64")` already returns the typed
affine Int64 flat index, string/object casts already iterate `value_at(position)` directly, and the existing
`range_index_astype_uses_direct_values_up4dq` unit test covers name propagation, descending values, typed Int64
backing, and unsupported dtype errors. Kept the benchmark and evidence because all measured ratios are wins, not
~0-gain.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — Nullable-Float64 dense groupby reductions: 0.43–0.47x loss -> 2.14–3.80x win @1M
DataFrameGroupBy sum/mean/min/count/std on a single dense Int64 key with a Float64 VALUE
column that contains MISSING values fell off the dense `aggregate_int64_dense` ->
`dense_aggregate_emit` fast path. That emit only handled `as_f64_slice` (all-valid, no NaN/Null)
and `as_i64_slice`, so any value column WITH missing entries was excluded by the gate and dropped
to the generic `build_groups` path (SipHash grouping + per-group Scalar-closure scans) — measured
0.43–0.47x pandas. Extended the gate in `aggregate_named_func` to admit nullable Float64
(`as_f64_slice_with_validity`) for exactly the funcs `dense_aggregate_emit` now implements
(sum/mean/count/min/max/var/std), and added a typed skipna accumulation arm over `(data,
validity)`: sum/count single-pass; mean single-pass accumulate+count; var/std two-pass
mean-centered ddof=1 (count<2 -> NaN); min/max first-valid tracking (all-missing -> NaN).
BIT-IDENTICAL to the generic path's nan* reductions (all-missing group -> sum 0.0,
mean/min/max/var/std NaN, count 0; same two-pass folds). Bench `bench_gbnull` @1M rows /
1000 groups / 20% missing, fp before = generic path (lib.rs change stashed), fp after = dense path:

| op   | before (generic) | after (dense) | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|------|------------------|---------------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| sum  | 42.99ms          | 5.40ms        | 18.83ms  | 0.44x          | 3.49x         | 7.96x   |
| mean | 46.05ms          | 5.68ms        | 21.56ms  | 0.47x          | 3.80x         | 8.11x   |
| min  | 41.00ms          | 5.64ms        | 17.72ms  | 0.43x          | 3.14x         | 7.27x   |
| std  | 43.52ms          | 9.59ms        | 20.48ms  | 0.47x          | 2.14x         | 4.54x   |

All four flip LOSS -> WIN. Correctness pinned by new `groupby_nullable_dense_conformance`
(5 tests, hand-computed expected covering multi-element, single-element std->NaN, and
all-missing groups) — all pass. pandas baseline: float64 column with NaN, same splitmix-scrambled
keys/values, best-of-6. Bench command:
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc cargo run -p fp-frame --example bench_gbnull --release -- <op>`.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — Nullable-Float64 dense groupby prod/first/last/median: 0.43–0.90x -> 3.02–3.64x win @1M
Follow-up to the same-day nullable-f64 dense groupby reduction landing (c372fd4be), which only
admitted sum/mean/count/min/max/var/std. The dense `dense_aggregate_emit` all-valid f64 arm ALSO
implements prod/first/last/median, but the nullable gate excluded them, so a Float64 value column
WITH missing values still fell to the generic `build_groups` path for those four funcs — measured
0.43–0.50x pandas (prod/first/last) and 0.90x (median). Widened the nullable gate to admit
prod/first/last/median and added their skipna arms to the `(data, validity)` branch: prod skips
missing and folds from 1.0 (all-missing -> 1.0, bit-identical to `nanprod`); first/last take the
first/last VALID value in ascending row order (all-missing -> NaN, matching the generic
`find(|v| !v.is_missing())` / reverse-find); median uses a new `dense_group_median_f64_skipna`
(CSR over valid values only + the same `typed_median_f64_slice`, all-missing -> NaN, bit-identical
to `nanmedian(valid)`). Bench `bench_gbnull` @1M rows / 1000 groups / 20% missing, fp before =
generic path (lib.rs change unstaged), fp after = dense path:

| op     | before (generic) | after (dense) | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|--------|------------------|---------------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| prod   | 40.47ms          | 5.25ms        | 19.13ms  | 0.47x          | 3.64x         | 7.71x   |
| first  | 36.18ms          | 5.81ms        | 18.24ms  | 0.50x          | 3.14x         | 6.23x   |
| last   | 43.41ms          | 6.10ms        | 18.45ms  | 0.43x          | 3.02x         | 7.12x   |
| median | 43.30ms          | 12.79ms       | 39.01ms  | 0.90x          | 3.05x         | 3.39x   |

All four flip to WINS (median 0.90x -> 3.05x is not ~0-gain). Correctness pinned by extending
`groupby_nullable_dense_conformance` to 9 tests (added prod/first/last/median with hand-computed
expected: all-missing prod -> 1.0, first/last skip leading/trailing NaN, median over valid) — all
9 pass. pandas baseline: float64 column with NaN, same splitmix-scrambled keys/values, best-of-6.
Bench command:
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc cargo run -p fp-frame --example bench_gbnull --release -- <op>`.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — Nullable-Float64 dense SeriesGroupBy sum/mean/min/max: 0.39–0.43x -> 3.55–3.79x win @1M
Parallel to the same-day DataFrameGroupBy nullable-f64 dense work (c372fd4be/009bd97b1), but on the
SeriesGroupBy side (`Series.groupby(int64_key).sum()/mean()/min()/max()`). `SeriesGroupBy::dense_group_fold`
(the single-fold dense reducer that sum/mean/min/max share) gated on `as_f64_slice()`/`as_i64_slice()`
(all-valid only), so a Float64 value column WITH missing values fell to the slow generic `agg_numeric`
build_groups path (per-group `Vec<f64>` gather + closure re-scan) — measured 0.39–0.43x pandas. Added a
nullable `as_f64_slice_with_validity` branch: skipna fold (only non-missing slots folded/counted), and
the emit now maps `count==0 -> Scalar::Null(NullKind::NaN)` so an all-missing group matches `agg_numeric`'s
`nums.is_empty() -> Null(NaN)` arm (applies to sum too — distinct from DataFrameGroupBy where all-missing
sum is 0.0). Bit-identical to `agg_numeric`: same `is_missing()`-skip + `to_f64()` (inf kept, not dropped),
same ascending-row fold order, same first-seen gid order/labels. The all-valid fold path is untouched
(`count[g] > 0` always there, so the new `count==0` arm never fires for it). Bench `bench_sgbnull` @1M rows
/ 1000 groups / 20% missing, fp before = generic path (lib.rs change stashed), fp after = dense path,
measured back-to-back under the same machine load (std/median paths are unchanged by the edit and read
52.7/64.8ms before vs 50.3/59.8ms after, confirming equal load):

| op   | before (generic) | after (dense) | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |

max shares the identical `dense_group_fold` code (NEG_INFINITY/`f64::max`) — covered by conformance,
not separately benched (~min). All flip LOSS -> WIN. Correctness pinned by new
`sgb_nullable_dense_conformance` (4 tests: sum/mean/min/max, hand-computed with an all-missing group ->
Null(NaN) per agg_numeric) — all green. NOT claimed: SeriesGroupBy nullable std (50.3ms, 0.50x) and median
(59.8ms, ~0.98x) use separate paths (std -> agg_numeric directly; median -> its own) and are UNCHANGED;
left as documented follow-ups. pandas baseline: float64 Series with NaN, same splitmix keys, best-of-6.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — Dense SeriesGroupBy var/std (incl. nullable-f64): 0.42–0.43x -> 1.99x win @1M
Continuation of the SeriesGroupBy nullable-f64 work (476402d66). `SeriesGroupBy::std` had NO dense path
(it went straight to `agg_numeric` for ALL inputs), and `var`'s dense two-pass block gated `as_f64_slice()`/
`as_i64_slice()` (all-valid only) — so a Float64 value column WITH missing values fell to the slow generic
`agg_numeric` build_groups gather for BOTH var and std (measured 0.42–0.43x pandas). Extracted a single
shared `dense_group_var_std(want_std)` helper that handles int64 / all-valid-f64 / nullable-f64 value
columns over the dense gid layout: pass 1 sums+counts per gid (skipna: only non-missing fold/count), pass 2
accumulates squared deviations, emit ssd/(n-1) (sqrt for std). `var()` now calls it (replacing its inline
all-valid-only block) and `std()` calls it before its `agg_numeric` fallback. Bit-identical to agg_numeric's
var/std closures: first-seen gids/labels, ascending value-order sums (== the `is_missing()`-skipped `to_f64()`
order), `(x-mean).powi(2)`, and the emit matches the generic wrap exactly — all-missing group (n==0) ->
`Null(NaN)`, n==1 -> `Float64(NaN)`, n>=2 -> `Float64(value)`. All-valid var is unchanged (n>=1, so the
n==0 arm never fires); all-valid std becomes bit-identical (same ascending sums -> same mean/ssd -> same
var.sqrt()). Bench `bench_sgbnull` @1M / 1000 groups / 20% missing, before (stashed helper) vs after under
equal load (load-check sum 7.02 vs 7.03ms, median 60.0 vs 58.8ms):

| op  | before (agg_numeric) | after (dense) | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|-----|----------------------|---------------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| var | 49.29ms              | 10.48ms       | 20.90ms  | 0.42x          | 1.99x         | 4.70x   |
| std | 49.80ms              | 10.80ms       | 21.54ms  | 0.43x          | 1.99x         | 4.61x   |

Both flip LOSS -> WIN. Correctness pinned by extending `sgb_nullable_dense_conformance` to 6 tests (added
var/std: group [2,4,6] -> var 4/std 2, singletons + all-missing -> NaN) — all green. pandas baseline:
float64 Series with NaN, same splitmix keys, best-of-6. Remaining SeriesGroupBy nullable gap: median (~0.98x,
near parity, separate path) — not pursued.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — typed nullable-f64 Series sum/mean/var/std: var 1.06x->1.66x (parity->win), std 1.53x->2.43x @1M
Series-level (not groupby) reductions had typed all-valid f64 fast paths but a Float64 column WITH missing
values fell to a `self.column.values()` Scalar loop — materializing a 1M-element `Vec<Scalar>` and matching
each element. Added typed `as_f64_slice_with_validity` skipna branches to `Series::sum` (the f64 default arm)
and `Series::var` (the second-pass squared-deviation fold); mean (= sum/count) and std (= var.sqrt()) inherit
the speedup. Bit-identical to the Scalar loop: same non-missing values in row order, same 0.0-seeded `+`
(sum) and `(v-mean)^2` fold (var), `count()` already a popcount. Bench `bench_series_null` @1M / 20% missing,
best-of-8, before = Scalar loop (stashed), after = typed; before/after measured ~6 min apart on the same host
(the uniform ~1.6x fp-side speedup across all four independent ops confirms it is the lever, not load):

| op   | before (Scalar loop) | after (typed) | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|------|----------------------|---------------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| var  | 10.71ms              | 6.81ms        | 11.30ms  | 1.06x (parity) | 1.66x WIN     | 1.57x   |
| std  | 10.89ms              | 6.84ms        | 16.64ms  | 1.53x WIN      | 2.43x WIN     | 1.59x   |
| mean | 5.24ms               | 3.26ms        | 2.68ms   | 0.51x          | 0.82x         | 1.61x   |
| sum  | 5.20ms               | 3.26ms        | 2.03ms   | 0.39x          | 0.62x         | 1.59x   |

HONEST: var flips parity->win and std strengthens to 2.43x — the headline wins. sum/mean improve 1.6x
fp-side and bit-identical but REMAIN below pandas (0.62x/0.82x): pandas' `np.nansum`/`nanmean` are SIMD
(NaN-blend vectorized over the f64 buffer), while fp's safe per-element `validity.get(i)` conditional add
is scalar — closing that needs SIMD intrinsics (unsafe, forbidden by default) and the branchless mul/select
forms break bit-identity (NaN*0 / signed-zero). Kept because the change is a strict bit-identical fp-side
improvement (necessary plumbing for the var/std wins, no regression — all-valid path guarded). Correctness:
new `series_nullable_reduction_conformance` (6 tests: nullable sum/mean/var/std, all-missing, all-valid
regression guard) green. pandas baseline best-of-8, float64 Series with NaN.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — Series cumsum/cummax 0.40–0.44x LOSS = the f64-arc-copy-on-produce floor (surfaced + evidence)
Probed 7 all-valid-f64 Series ops @1M (`bench_probe`) to find a fresh winnable lever. fp WINS most, but
cumsum/cummax/diff (the f64-array-PRODUCING ops) LOSE — and the cause is the known structural
`f64-arc-copy-on-produce` floor, not a missing fast path. cumsum/cummax already have typed all-valid f64
fast paths: they build a `Vec<f64>` prefix/running fold then `Column::from_f64_values(out)`. That
constructor (a) scans the 8MB output for NaN, then (b) `Arc::from(Vec<f64>)` into `LazyAllValidFloat64`'s
`data: Arc<[f64]>` — and `Arc<[T]>`'s layout (refcount header + data in ONE allocation) FORCES a full data
copy; `Arc::from(Vec)` can never reuse the Vec's separate buffer. So fp pays ~3 passes over 8MB (fold-write,
NaN-scan, Arc-copy) vs pandas' ~2 (read+write) -> ~2.3x. Measured vs pandas 2.2.3, best-of-6 @1M all-valid f64:

| op         | fp       | pandas   | ratio       |
|------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| cumsum     | 7.56ms   | 3.34ms   | 0.44x LOSS  |
| cummax     | 7.73ms   | 3.08ms   | 0.40x LOSS  |
| diff       | 0.81ms   | 0.35ms   | 0.43x (sub-ms) |
| pct_change | 1.46ms   | 18.98ms  | 13.0x WIN   |
| rank       | 32.97ms  | 130.67ms | 3.96x WIN   |
| nlargest   | 9.95ms   | 20.28ms  | 2.04x WIN   |
| mode       | 15.46ms  | 32.92ms  | 2.13x WIN   |

BLOCKER (why not fixed here): the fix is an owned-`Vec<f64>` / `Arc<Vec<f64>>` all-valid-Float64
`ScalarValues` variant that MOVES the output Vec instead of copying it (mirroring the existing
`LazyNullableFloat64`, which IS Vec-backed and copy-free — but `from_f64_values_with_validity` routes an
ALL-valid mask straight back to the copying `from_f64_values`). This is genuinely entangled: the current
`Arc<[f64]>` backing is shared ZERO-COPY with `LazyAllValidFloat64Slice` (take_positions row-range views),
which an `Arc<Vec<f64>>` cannot provide without re-copying; and a Vec-backed variant trades O(1) `Column::clone`
for an 8MB deep copy on clone. So it is a structural fp-columnar change with a real trade-off + many match
sites (peer-contended file), NOT a contained fast-path add — deferred, consistent with the prior
`f64-arc-copy-on-produce` note. No production code changed; `bench_probe` added as standing evidence.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — Series.autocorr typed f64 path: 1.38x -> 13.4x @1M (9.7x fp-side, bit-identical)
Probed scalar-output Series ops (`bench_probe2`) for a non-arc-bound lever. corr/cov already have typed
two-pass paths (cov_components) and sit ~parity (bandwidth-bound); but `Series::autocorr` had NO typed path
— it materialized `self.column.values()` (a 1M-element Vec<Scalar> = ~32MB) and built two more pair Vecs,
even for an all-valid Float64 column. Added a typed `as_f64_slice` fast path: two linear passes over the raw
f64 buffer with a `lag` offset (means, then centered cross/var sums), no Scalar materialization, no pair
Vecs. Bit-identical to the Scalar loop: an `as_f64_slice` column is all-valid with no NaN (from_f64_values
marks NaN missing), so the original missing/NaN-skip never fired and count==n with x/y == data[0..n] /
data[lag..len]; same sums in the same order, same `cov/sqrt(var_x*var_y)` with the identical
`< f64::EPSILON => NaN` guard. Bench `bench_probe2 autocorr` @1M all-valid f64, before/after under equal
load (unchanged corr path read 5.74 vs 5.66ms):

| op       | before (Scalar) | after (typed) | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| autocorr | 13.66ms         | 1.41ms        | 18.83ms  | 1.38x          | 13.36x        | 9.70x   |

Was already a marginal win (1.38x) but the Vec<Scalar> materialization dominated; removing it is a 9.7x
fp-side speedup. Correctness pinned by new `autocorr_typed_conformance` (5 tests vs an independent oracle:
lag1/lag5, linear->1.0, constant->NaN, short->NaN) — all green. Same probe confirms fp already WINS
quantile 6.05x, nunique 2.23x, duplicated 1.17x; corr/cov ~parity (0.94x/0.95x, bandwidth-bound, typed paths
already present — not pursued). pandas baseline best-of-6, float64 Series.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — Series.skew/kurt typed f64 fused-pass: 5.1x -> ~14x @1M (2.7x fp-side, bit-identical)
Probed scalar-output moment ops (`bench_probe3`). sem already uses typed Welford (`numeric_moments`, no
copy) and median/prod already win — but `Series::skew`/`kurtosis` called `numeric_values`, which (even on
its typed branch) COPIES the whole all-valid buffer into a `vals: Vec<f64>` and computes the mean over it,
then skew/kurt re-scan `vals` TWICE more (m2+m3, or m2+m4) — ~5 passes over 8MB. Added a typed `as_f64_slice`
fast path to both: compute the mean in one pass then a FUSED single pass accumulating m2 & m3 (skew) / m2 &
m4 (kurt) straight off the slice — no vals Vec, 2 passes total. Bit-identical: `as_f64_slice` is all-valid
no-NaN (from_f64_values marks NaN missing), so `numeric_values`' present-filter keeps everything =>
`vals == data` (index order) and the same `Σdata/n` mean; m2/m3/m4 are the same `(v-mean).powi(k)` terms
summed in the same order (fusing two independent sums into one pass changes no term). Nullable columns don't
hit the gate and keep the existing path. Bench `bench_probe3` @1M all-valid f64, before/after equal load
(unchanged sem path read 4.74ms both, median ~1.5ms):

| op   | before  | after   | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|------|---------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| skew | 3.87ms  | 1.41ms  | 19.68ms  | 5.08x          | 13.96x        | 2.75x   |
| kurt | 3.82ms  | 1.41ms  | 19.75ms  | 5.17x          | 14.01x        | 2.71x   |

Already wins, but the vals copy + extra re-scans dominated — removing them is 2.7x fp-side. Correctness
pinned by new `skew_kurt_typed_conformance` (4 tests vs independent oracle: skew/kurt match, constant->0.0,
too-few->NaN) — all green. Same probe confirms fp already WINS sem 4.41x (typed Welford), median 12.6x,
prod 1.52x. pandas baseline best-of-6.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — DataFrame std/var/skew axis=1 typed f64 output: ~10x -> ~13-15x @1M×8 (1.2-1.3x fp-side)
Probed DataFrame row-axis (axis=1) reductions (`bench_probe_df`, 1M rows × 8 f64 cols). pandas axis=1 is
TERRIBLE (block-manager gather + Python per-row): std 213ms, var 206ms, skew 334ms, sum 82ms — fp already
WINS everything 6-12x. But sum/mean/max axis=1 use the typed `reduce_rows_f64` while std/var/sem/skew/kurt
use `reduce_rows_func_f64`, which boxed each row's result into a `Vec<Scalar::Float64>` (32B/elem, ~32MB @1M)
then re-inferred dtype in `from_values`. Switched it to collect a `Vec<f64>` and ingest via `from_f64_values`
(typed, like the sum path). Bit-identical: `from_f64_values` marks a NaN-result row missing exactly as
`from_values` does for a `Scalar::Float64(NaN)` (both => missing), present rows store the same `Float64(v)`;
the per-row gather + reducer closure are untouched. Bench @1M×8, before/after equal load (unchanged sum path
11.32/11.28ms):

| op (axis=1) | before  | after   | pandas    | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|-------------|---------|---------|-----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| std         | 20.78ms | 16.43ms | 213.28ms  | 10.26x         | 12.98x        | 1.26x   |
| var         | 17.72ms | 14.00ms | 205.51ms  | 11.60x         | 14.68x        | 1.27x   |
| skew        | 38.39ms | 34.65ms | 333.74ms  | 8.69x          | 9.63x         | 1.11x   |

Already dominant wins; the typed output strengthens std/var ~1.27x fp-side (skew ~1.11x, its row_skew compute
dominates). sem/kurt axis=1 share `reduce_rows_func_f64` so they inherit it too. Correctness: new
`df_axis1_f64_typed_conformance` (var/std vs independent oracle + zero-variance-row 0.0 guard) + existing
`row_reduction_conformance` green. Same probe: sum 7.27x, mean 6.41x, max 6.39x already win (typed
`reduce_rows_f64`). pandas baseline best-of-6.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — fp-index Utf8 Index.intersection: 0.70x LOSS -> 1.19x WIN @1M (1.69x fp-side, bit-identical)
Probed unsorted Utf8 Index set-ops (`probe_str_setops`) vs pandas 2.2.3. fp WINS get_indexer 4.5x, isin 3.0x
(pandas object-Index is brutally slow: intersection 286ms, UNION 1.49s, isin 503ms) — but `Index::intersection`
was a LOSS: 408ms vs pandas 286ms = 0.70x. CAUSE: the generic path builds `other.position_map_first_ref()`
(FxHashMap<&IndexLabel> over all of other) AND a SECOND `seen: FxHashMap<&IndexLabel>` dedup set — ~2.5M
pointer-keyed string-hash probes (each chasing &IndexLabel -> 32B enum -> String -> heap bytes). Added a typed
all-Utf8 fast path (sibling of the existing int64 `membership_filter_i64`): gate on both sides being pure
`IndexLabel::Utf8` (no Null), build ONE `FxHashMap<&str, bool>` over other, and dedup via a "matched" flag
stored IN that map — eliminating the separate seen-set (one hash map instead of two) and hashing `&str`
directly (skips the enum load). Bit-identical: same self-order, same first-occurrence dedup (a self label in
other emits once, then its flag suppresses repeats), same matched labels; the all-Utf8 gate (no Null) is what
makes dropping the `&IndexLabel` keys safe (the generic path would otherwise also match a Null self label
against a Null in other). `probe_str_setops` @1M, before/after (unchanged get_indexer ~60-68ms = load band):

| op           | before   | after    | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|--------------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| intersection | 408.35ms | 241.27ms | 286.34ms | 0.70x LOSS     | 1.19x WIN     | 1.69x   |

Flips LOSS -> WIN. Correctness: new `utf8_intersection_typed_conformance` (6 tests vs independent oracle:
overlap+dup, disjoint, full-overlap self-order, all-dup self, empty, larger shuffled) — all green. Same probe:
get_indexer 4.52x, isin 2.97x already WIN. OPEN: union/difference/symmetric_difference Utf8 share the same
`FxHashMap<&IndexLabel>` + seen pattern (pandas union is 1.49s — likely fp already wins but the same lever
applies). pandas baseline best-of-6.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — fp-index Utf8 union/difference/symdiff typed sweep: 1.85–2.57x fp-side @1M (bit-identical)
Follow-up to the Utf8 intersection win (a9dc31b19) — same lever applied to the other Utf8 set-ops. pandas
object-Index is brutally slow here (union 1.75s, difference 875ms, symmetric_difference 962ms). fp already WON
(union 3.02x, difference 2.03x, symdiff 1.23x) but each used pointer-keyed `FxHashMap<&IndexLabel>` with
redundant maps. Added typed all-Utf8 paths (gate: both sides pure IndexLabel::Utf8, no Null):
- **difference**: ONE `FxHashMap<&str,()>` seeded with other doubles as membership AND self-dedup —
  `insert(s).is_none()` is true only when s is neither in other nor already emitted (2 maps -> 1).
- **symmetric_difference**: the two halves are disjoint, so each membership map carries its OPPOSITE half's
  dedup (self-half deduped via other_set, other-half via self_set) — drops the shared `seen` (3 maps -> 2).
- **union_with**: dedup the self-then-other concat with `FxHashSet`-style `&str` keys instead of
  `&IndexLabel` (skips the 32B enum load per probe; still one map).
All bit-identical (same order, first-occurrence dedup, same labels). `probe_str_setops` @1M (intersection
244ms unchanged from a9dc31b19 = stable load):

| op                   | before   | after    | pandas    | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|----------------------|----------|----------|-----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| union                | 580.59ms | 314.04ms | 1753.10ms | 3.02x          | 5.58x         | 1.85x   |
| difference           | 431.74ms | 167.74ms | 874.76ms  | 2.03x          | 5.21x         | 2.57x   |
| symmetric_difference | 784.76ms | 357.40ms | 962.05ms  | 1.23x          | 2.69x         | 2.20x   |

Correctness: new `utf8_setops_typed_conformance` (union/difference/symdiff vs independent oracles across
overlap+dup, disjoint, full-overlap self-order, all-dup, empty-self, empty-other, larger shuffled) — all
green; intersection conformance still green. pandas baseline best-of-4/6. The fp-index Utf8 set-op surface is
now fully typed (intersection/union/difference/symdiff), all WIN 1.2–5.6x; get_indexer 4.5x, isin 3.0x.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — fp-index Utf8 Index.value_counts: 0.80x LOSS -> 3.22x WIN @1M (4.02x fp-side, bit-identical)
Probed duplicate-heavy unsorted Utf8 Index dedup/count ops (`probe_str_dedup`, 1M rows / 10k distinct) vs
pandas 2.2.3. fp WINS unique 1.62x, nunique 1.53x, duplicated 1.75x, drop_duplicates 1.82x — but
`Index::value_counts` was a LOSS (66.57ms vs pandas 53.23ms = 0.80x). CAUSE: the generic Utf8 path tallied an
`FxHashMap<IndexLabel, usize>` with CLONED KEYS — `contains_key(label)` THEN `*counts.entry(label.clone())`
allocates a fresh `String` for EVERY one of the 1M input labels (plus a redundant second hash per label).
Added a typed all-Utf8 path: tally `&str` keys with a single `entry(s).or_insert(0)` per label, tracking
first-seen order, and clone a `String` only once per DISTINCT label (10k) when building the final pairs.
Bit-identical: same first-seen order, same per-label counts, same `sort_by_key` (stable -> first-seen breaks
ties); the all-Utf8 gate (no Null) makes `dropna` moot (total == len). `probe_str_dedup` @1M/10k, before/after
(unchanged unique/duplicated read ~22-23ms both = stable load):

| op           | before  | after   | pandas  | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| value_counts | 66.57ms | 16.55ms | 53.23ms | 0.80x LOSS     | 3.22x WIN     | 4.02x   |

Flips LOSS -> WIN. Correctness: new `utf8_value_counts_typed_conformance` (5 tests vs independent oracle:
counts-descending, first-seen tie-break, single value, empty, larger dup-heavy) — all green. Same probe: fp
already WINS unique 1.62x, nunique 1.53x, duplicated 1.75x, drop_duplicates 1.82x (those use the lighter
`FxHashMap<&IndexLabel>` pointer path, not cloned keys). pandas baseline best-of-6.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — fp-index Utf8 get_indexer_non_unique: 3.07x -> 7.14x @1M (2.33x fp-side, bit-identical)
Hunting the `entry(label.clone())` String-alloc-per-row smell (same root as the value_counts fix 409340f38),
found `Index::get_indexer_non_unique` on a Utf8 source built its position map as
`FxHashMap<IndexLabel, Vec<usize>>` with `entry(label.clone())` — a String alloc for EVERY source row (1M).
fp already WON (70.74ms vs pandas 217ms = 3.07x, pandas non-unique reindex is slow) but paid the clones. Added
a typed all-Utf8 path: key the source position map on `&str` (no clone), gated on BOTH source and target pure
Utf8 (no Null) so every target label is a `&str` lookup (no skipped emissions). Bit-identical: same per-key
source-order position lists, same target-order indexer, same missing list. `probe_str_ginu` @1M/10k (dup-heavy
source, target = 2*card distinct):

| op                     | before  | after   | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|------------------------|---------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| get_indexer_non_unique | 70.74ms | 30.42ms | 217.13ms | 3.07x          | 7.14x         | 2.33x   |

Removing the 1M per-row String allocations is 2.33x fp-side. Correctness: new `utf8_ginu_typed_conformance`
(6 tests vs independent oracle: duplicates+missing, all-missing, empty target/source, source-order position
preservation, larger dup-heavy) — all green. SMELL CONFIRMED REUSABLE: `entry(k.clone())` over an
`FxHashMap<IndexLabel,_>` in a per-row loop = a String alloc per row; the typed `&str` key removes it. pandas
baseline best-of-6.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — fp-join merge output sort: factorize+counting-sort — outer 0.22x->0.41x @1M (1.85x fp-side, bit-identical)
Probed Utf8 inner/left/outer/right merge (`bench_merge_utf8`, 1M ⋈ 10k) vs pandas 2.2.3. fp WINS inner
2.20x, parity left 1.04x, but OUTER was a CATASTROPHIC LOSS (770ms vs pandas 172ms = 0.22x) and right 0.79x.
pandas outer-merge output is sorted by the join key (verified: sort=False still yields key-sorted output), so
fp must sort too — but `sort_merge_rows_by_join_keys` did an O(n·log n) COMPARISON sort
(`order.sort_by(|a,b| out_row_keys[a].cmp(out_row_keys[b]))`), re-comparing full CompositeJoinKeys (string
compares for Utf8) ~n·log n times. Replaced with FACTORIZE + STABLE COUNTING-SORT: dedup the keys, sort only
the DISTINCT keys once (d≪n, here 10k), assign dense ranks, then counting-sort the n rows by rank — O(n +
d·log d), key comparisons paid only on the d distinct keys. Generic (any CompositeJoinKey via its Hash+Eq+Ord),
so it also speeds up sort=True inner/left/right. Bit-identical to the stable comparison sort: rank order == key
`cmp` order; the counting sort emits each rank's rows in ascending original-index order == the stable `sort_by`
permutation. Bench @1M/10k, load-normalized (inner load-check 65.6 vs 67.7ms):

| op (merge)   | before   | after    | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|--------------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| outer        | 770.27ms | 417.30ms | 172.13ms | 0.22x          | 0.41x         | 1.85x   |

HONEST: outer is STILL A LOSS (0.41x) — the counting-sort removed the ~350ms O(n log n) string sort, but ~350ms
of outer-specific overhead remains (reindex_outer_join_column rebuilding each output column by position +
collect_single_join_keys materializing Vec<JoinKeyComponent>). Kept because it is a real bit-identical 1.85x
fp-side improvement on the WORST join loss + speeds every key-sorted merge, not ~0-gain. Correctness: new
`utf8_outer_merge_sort_conformance` (3 tests vs pandas-verified order incl. stable within-key + d==1 + all-
distinct) + existing `merge_composite_outer_sorts_join_keys_lexicographically` lib test green. RESIDUAL LEVER
(documented, next): typed reindex_outer_join_column + &str key extraction to close the remaining outer gap.
pandas baseline best-of-8.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — Series.str.contains/match/startswith typed Bool output: regex 4.69x->10.05x @1M (2.15x fp-side, bit-identical)
`Series.str.contains(pat)` defaults to regex=True (pandas), routing through `str_boolean_with_na`, which had
NO typed path — it materialized `column.values()` (Vec<Scalar>) AND boxed each result into a
`Vec<Scalar::Float64/Bool>` (32B/elem, ~32MB @1M) + `from_values`. Added a typed Bool-output path (mirror of
`apply_str_bool`): an all-valid contiguous-Utf8 input scans byte spans straight into a `Vec<bool>` (no
`values()` materialization), and an all-valid non-contiguous Utf8 input still emits a `Vec<bool>` (na is moot
with no missing rows) — both via `from_bool_values` (1B/elem). Serves str.contains/match/startswith/endswith
with options. Bit-identical: every row is present Utf8, so the generic arm emits `Scalar::Bool(pred(s))` for
each, which `from_bool_values(Vec<bool>)` reproduces exactly (rcvpj: from_bool_values == from_values for Bool).
Bench `bench_str_contains` @1M (Scalar-backed Utf8, all-valid-Vec<bool> path):

| op (contains)   | before  | after   | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|-----------------|---------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| regex (default) | 27.75ms | 12.93ms | 130.02ms | 4.69x          | 10.05x        | 2.15x   |
| literal         | 39.44ms | 23.64ms | 88.05ms  | 2.23x          | 3.72x         | 1.67x   |

Both already win; removing the Vec<Scalar::Bool> output boxing is 1.67–2.15x fp-side and strengthens every
str predicate-with-options op. Correctness: new `str_boolean_typed_conformance` (5 tests: literal, regex,
anchored, case-insensitive, empty) green. pandas baseline best-of-6. (A contiguous-Utf8 input would skip the
values() materialization too, for an even bigger win — out of scope for the Scalar-backed bench.)

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — Series.str.replace/repeat contiguous output: replace 1.08x->2.41x @1M (2.23x fp-side, bit-identical)
Series.str.replace / repeat (Utf8-OUTPUT ops) used the slow `apply_str` — boxing a `Vec<Scalar::Utf8>` (32B +
a heap String per row, 1M) then `from_values`. lower/upper/strip already route through `apply_str_utf8` (writes
each row's output bytes into ONE rolling buffer -> `from_utf8_contiguous`, no per-row Scalar/String boxing).
Converted replace + repeat to `apply_str_utf8` too: the write closure appends the row's replaced/repeated
bytes to the buffer (replace's temp `s.replace` String is dropped immediately; repeat appends the source bytes
n times — no temp). The fallback keeps the missing/non-Utf8 path. Bit-identical: same per-row output string at
every slot; missing-bearing input still hits the Scalar fallback (preserves nulls). Bench `bench_str_replace`
@1M all-valid Utf8:

| op      | before   | after   | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|---------|----------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| replace | 133.78ms | 59.93ms | 144.20ms | 1.08x (parity) | 2.41x WIN      | 2.23x   |
| repeat  | 83.71ms  | 28.71ms | 482.00ms | 5.76x          | 16.79x         | 2.92x   |

replace FLIPS ~parity -> a clear win; repeat 5.76x -> 16.79x. Correctness: new
`str_replace_repeat_typed_conformance` (4 tests: replace/repeat all-valid + missing-fallback for both) green.
OPEN: other Utf8-output apply_str users (capitalize/title/pad/center/slice option arms) can take the same
apply_str_utf8 route. pandas baseline best-of-6.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — Series.str.capitalize 0.49x->13.20x + title 1.18x->1.93x @1M (bit-identical)
Continued the Utf8-output str sweep. capitalize/title used the slow `apply_str` (Vec<Scalar::Utf8> output).
Two levers: (1) route both through `apply_str_utf8` (contiguous byte-buffer output, no per-row Scalar/String
boxing); (2) capitalize was STILL a loss after (1) — its transform did `format!("{upper}{rest}")` + char
`to_uppercase`/`to_lowercase` iterators PER ROW (Unicode case folding). Added an ASCII byte-ops fast path
(mirror of str.lower's 2krr0): for an ASCII row, append the bytes then `make_ascii_uppercase` the first byte /
`make_ascii_lowercase` the rest, IN the output buffer — no temp String, no char iterators, vectorizable.
Bit-identical: ASCII `to_uppercase`/`to_lowercase` IS the ASCII map (no context-sensitive cases); non-ASCII
rows keep the Unicode path; missing rows hit the Scalar fallback. Bench `bench_str_replace` @1M ASCII Utf8:

| op         | before   | after   | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|------------|----------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| capitalize | 275.01ms | 10.25ms | 135.23ms | 0.49x LOSS      | 13.20x WIN     | 26.83x  |
| title      | 137.96ms | 84.11ms | 162.74ms | 1.18x          | 1.93x WIN      | 1.64x   |

capitalize FLIPS catastrophic loss -> dominant win (the format!+Unicode-iterator was the entire cost); title
parity -> clear win via the contiguous output. Correctness: new `str_capitalize_title_typed_conformance`
(5 tests vs pandas-verified: ASCII, Unicode case folding "éXY"->"Éxy", empty/single, missing-fallback) green.
OPEN: title could take the same ASCII byte-ops path (~8x more); other apply_str arms (pad/center/zfill/
swapcase/casefold) remain. pandas baseline best-of-6.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — Series.str.casefold 0.20x->7.26x + title 1.94x->8.27x @1M (bit-identical)
Continued the str ASCII byte-ops sweep (after capitalize 792e05b0a). casefold did `s.case_fold().collect()`
(Unicode aggressive case-folding iterator) per row via the slow apply_str — a CATASTROPHIC 442ms (0.20x
pandas). title was already on apply_str_utf8 (1.94x) but still used char `to_uppercase`/`to_lowercase`. Added
ASCII byte-ops fast paths to BOTH: casefold ASCII-lowercases in the output buffer (ASCII case-folding == ASCII
lowercasing — no multi-char foldings like ß->ss occur in pure ASCII); title walks the appended bytes marking
cased runs (a-zA-Z == the cased ASCII set). Bit-identical: ASCII byte-maps == the char Unicode ops for ASCII;
non-ASCII rows keep the Unicode path (case_fold / char iterators); missing -> Scalar fallback. Bench
`bench_str_replace` @1M ASCII:

| op       | before   | after   | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|----------|----------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| casefold | 442.34ms | 12.40ms | 89.99ms  | 0.20x LOSS      | 7.26x WIN      | 35.67x  |
| title    | 83.90ms  | 19.67ms | 162.74ms | 1.94x           | 8.27x WIN      | 4.27x   |

casefold FLIPS catastrophic loss -> win (the case_fold() iterator was 442ms); title parity-ish -> dominant
win. Correctness: new `str_casefold_title_ascii_conformance` (4 tests: ASCII+Unicode casefold incl.
"Straße"->"strasse", title ASCII/Unicode/missing — all pandas-verified) + existing capitalize/title suite
green. OPEN: swapcase (run-based Unicode, ASCII XOR-0x20 candidate), pad/center/zfill. pandas baseline best-of-6.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — Series.str.swapcase ASCII XOR-0x20 + contiguous output: 9.42x WIN @1M (bit-identical)
Completed the str-case ASCII byte-ops sweep. swapcase used the slow `apply_str` with a per-row run-grouping
char `to_lowercase`/`to_uppercase` Unicode transform (the SAME apply_str + char-case path that left casefold at
0.20x and capitalize at 0.49x before their fixes). Routed through `apply_str_utf8` (contiguous byte-buffer
output) with an ASCII fast path: XOR 0x20 toggles the case of an ASCII letter (A^0x20=a, a^0x20=A) in the
output buffer; non-letters untouched. Bit-identical for ASCII (a single ASCII letter's to_uppercase/
to_lowercase IS the XOR; a non-letter swaps to itself), non-ASCII keeps the Unicode run logic, missing ->
Scalar fallback. Bench `bench_str_replace` @1M ASCII:

| op       | after (this fix) | pandas    | after->pandas |
|----------|------------------|-----------|---------------|
| swapcase | 17.60ms          | 165.76ms  | 9.42x WIN     |

After measured 9.42x WIN. (Before — the slow run-based apply_str path — was not separately re-benched this
turn; it is the identical lever as casefold 442ms->12.4ms (0.20x->7.26x) and capitalize 275ms->10.2ms
(0.49x->13.2x), i.e. a ~10-30x fp-side reduction from removing the per-row char-case Unicode work.)
Correctness: new `str_swapcase_typed_conformance` (2 tests: ASCII+Unicode "éÀb"->"ÉàB", missing-fallback —
pandas-verified) green. The Series.str case-transform surface (lower/upper/strip/capitalize/title/casefold/
swapcase) is now fully on apply_str_utf8 + ASCII byte-ops. pandas baseline best-of-6.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — Series.str.pad/center/ljust/rjust/zfill contiguous output: zfill 1.25x->6.92x @1M (bit-identical)
Continued the Utf8-output str sweep onto the padding ops. pad/center/ljust/rjust (center/ljust/rjust delegate
to pad) and zfill used the slow `apply_str` — each built a per-row String + boxed a Vec<Scalar::Utf8> (32B +
a String per row) + from_values. Already MARGINAL wins (1.25-1.29x) but output-bound. Routed both through
`apply_str_utf8`: the write closure writes the fill chars + row bytes (or sign+zeros+rest for zfill) STRAIGHT
into one contiguous buffer — no per-row temp String, no Vec<Scalar::Utf8>. Extracted str_pad/str_zfill for the
Scalar fallback. Bit-identical: same fill chars / CPython-center both-split / zfill sign-first ordering; missing
-> fallback. Bench `bench_str_replace` @1M ASCII (width 30):

| op     | before   | after   | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| pad    | 110.07ms | 52.53ms | 139.89ms | 1.27x           | 2.66x WIN      | 2.10x   |
| center | 109.16ms | 48.98ms | 140.86ms | 1.29x           | 2.88x WIN      | 2.23x   |
| zfill  | 110.77ms | 20.01ms | 138.54ms | 1.25x           | 6.92x WIN      | 5.54x   |

All strengthen marginal -> clear/dominant wins (zfill best — '0' fill via buf.push(b'0'), no char encoding).
Correctness: new `str_pad_zfill_typed_conformance` (4 tests: pad both-split, center/ljust/rjust, zfill sign+
passthrough, missing-fallback for pad & zfill — pandas-verified) green. The Series.str Utf8-output surface
(lower/upper/strip/capitalize/title/casefold/swapcase/replace/repeat/pad/center/ljust/rjust/zfill) is now fully
on apply_str_utf8. pandas baseline best-of-6.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — Series.str is* predicates typed Bool output: isalnum 3.52x->13.75x @1M (bit-identical)
The str is* predicates (isdigit/isalpha/isalnum/isascii/isspace/islower/isupper/isnumeric/isdecimal/istitle)
used the slow `apply_str(|s| Scalar::Bool(pred))` — Vec<Scalar::Bool> (32B/elem) output + from_values — rather
than the typed `apply_str_bool` (contiguous Utf8 input -> Vec<bool> -> from_bool_values, 1B/elem) that the
contains-with-options fix (1c6844bd2) already used. Mechanical conversion of all 10. Bit-identical: same
predicate, typed Bool output == from_values over the equivalent Scalar::Bool (rcvpj). Bench `bench_str_replace`
@1M ASCII:

| op      | before  | after   | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| islower | 28.35ms | 11.31ms | 115.83ms | 4.09x           | 10.24x WIN     | 2.51x   |

| isdigit | 34.90ms | 19.36ms | 63.34ms  | 1.81x           | 3.27x WIN       | 1.80x   |

All strengthen already-winning predicates (isalnum best, 3.90x fp-side). Correctness: new
`str_is_predicates_typed_conformance` (6 tests: islower/isalnum/isdigit/isalpha/isupper/istitle vs pandas-
verified fixture) green. The Series.str bool-output surface is now fully on apply_str_bool. pandas best-of-6.

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — Series.str.removeprefix/removesuffix contiguous output: 2.96x->20.75x @1M (7x fp-side, bit-identical)
removeprefix/removesuffix used the slow `apply_str` — per-row `Scalar::Utf8(strip_*(..).unwrap_or(s).to_owned())`
(a String alloc per row) + Vec<Scalar::Utf8> + from_values. But strip_prefix/strip_suffix return a BORROWED
&str, so routed through `apply_str_utf8`: the write closure appends the stripped slice's bytes straight into
one contiguous buffer — NO per-row temp String (the cheapest str transform yet), no Scalar boxing. Bit-
identical: same single-occurrence strip / passthrough; missing -> Scalar fallback. Bench `bench_str_replace`
@1M ASCII:

| op           | before  | after   | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|--------------|---------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| removeprefix | 75.09ms | 10.71ms | 222.16ms | 2.96x           | 20.75x WIN     | 7.01x   |
| removesuffix | 78.62ms | 10.70ms | 195.60ms | 2.49x           | 18.28x WIN     | 7.35x   |

Both strengthen moderate -> dominant wins (pandas removeprefix/suffix are very slow). Correctness: new
`str_removeprefix_suffix_typed_conformance` (3 tests: matching/passthrough/single-strip + missing-fallback,
pandas-verified) green. pandas baseline best-of-6. (Also measured fp `write_csv` 40k×60 = 279.5ms vs pandas
to_csv 668.3ms = 2.39x WIN — already fast, no change.)

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — fp-io read_csv 9.82x / write_csv 2.39x WIN (measured evidence, no change)
Probed the classic pandas-slow IO surface (untouched this session) for a winnable lever; fp DOMINATES, no
change needed. Measured vs pandas 2.2.3:
- read_csv (`read_csv_str`, cache-MISSING via probe_csv_read_uncached, 100k rows × 10 f64, 18.2MB): fp
  15.65ms (1161 MB/s) vs pandas read_csv(StringIO) 153.76ms = **9.82x WIN**.
- write_csv (`write_csv_string`, 40k rows × 60 mixed int/float/null via bench_to_csv): fp 279.5ms vs pandas
  to_csv 668.3ms = **2.39x WIN**.
Recorded as standing evidence (don't re-probe fp-io for a loss).

### 2026-06-24 SlateOtter — surface-dominance checkpoint (after 19 str/reduction/index/join wins)
After ~21 commits this session, the COMMON fp surfaces are fp-dominant vs pandas. Probed-and-confirmed WINS
not to re-chase: the entire Series.str accessor (case transforms / replace / repeat / pad family / is*
predicates / removeprefix-suffix — all on apply_str_utf8/apply_str_bool, 2-35x fp-side after this session's
conversions); Series/DataFrame/Index nullable-f64 + autocorr/skew/kurt/axis1 reductions; fp-index Utf8 set-ops
/ value_counts / get_indexer_non_unique; fp-io read_csv/write_csv; Series.map (typed Int64/dense). The
REMAINING measured non-wins are all DOCUMENTED STRUCTURAL FLOORS, not quick levers: (1) f64-arc-copy-on-produce
(cumsum/cummax/diff/abs ~0.4x — needs an owned-Vec<f64> ScalarValues variant, entangled with take_positions
zero-copy slice sharing); (2) Series sum/mean nullable-f64 ~0.6-0.8x (numpy nansum is SIMD; safe scalar
validity.get can't match, branchless forms break bit-identity); (3) fp-join merge OUTER 0.41x / RIGHT 0.79x
(residual reindex_outer_join_column + collect_single_join_keys Vec<Scalar>/JoinKeyComponent String clones —
intricate, the counting-sort already took outer 0.22x->0.41x). map_dict is DEAD CODE (Scalar: !Ord, BTreeMap
arg unconstructable). These floors need coordinated structural work on a quiet box, not a per-op typed-path.

### 2026-06-25 BlackThrush — Series.filter same-index Bool mask gather: 21.40x LOSS->1.78x LOSS vs pandas @2M (bit-identical)
`Series::filter(mask_series)` still cloned one `IndexLabel` plus one `Scalar` per kept row on the common
identical-index, no-duplicate mask path, even though `loc_bool(&[bool])` already used a positions vector with
`Index::take` + `Column::take_positions`. BOLD-verified the live gap with the warmed per-crate command
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a rch exec -- cargo run -p fp-frame --example
bench_loc_bool --release -- 2000000 30`; RCH had no admissible worker and failed open locally, but the target dir
was warm and the command stayed `-p fp-frame`. Baseline current-main `filter_series` best 62.63ms vs pandas
2.93ms (21.40x pandas). The lever skips mask `Vec<Scalar>` materialization for Bool/Boolean dtype masks and
routes the same-index path through positions + typed index/column gathers. After: 5.04ms best-of-30 and 5.22ms
best-of-50, golden `0e95636b5d230bf5` unchanged; pandas comparator best 2.93ms with the same golden, so the
remaining ratio is 1.72-1.78x pandas and the fp-side speedup is 12.44x. This is still a pandas loss, but it
removes the catastrophic clone/materialization gap; next lever should attack the positions vector scan/gather
itself or reuse bool affine witnesses for common masks. Post-format remote rerun on `vmi1149989` stayed green
with the same golden and 4.24ms best-of-30; that is supplemental only, not used for the local pandas ratio.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — str.get typed nullable-Utf8 output = ~0-gain (REVERTED); char-iteration-bound not output-bound
Tried extending the apply_str_utf8 lever to NULL-producing str ops (str.get): added an `apply_str_opt_utf8`
helper (write closure returns bool present/null -> contiguous bytes+offsets+validity via
`from_utf8_values_with_validity` = LazyNullableUtf8, no Vec<Scalar::Utf8> boxing) and routed str.get through
it. Measured @1M ASCII (get(3)): before (apply_str) 79.99ms, after (helper) 76.71ms = **1.04x fp-side = ~0-gain
-> REVERTED**. CAUSE: str.get is dominated by the per-row `s.chars().count()` (bound check) + `s.chars().nth(i)`
O(len) iteration, NOT the output boxing — and an ASCII byte-index fast path doesn't help either because
`s.is_ascii()` scans the whole string per row (same O(len) cost as chars().count()). str.get already WINS 1.55x
vs pandas (126ms) on the char-iteration alone. LESSON: the typed-OUTPUT lever only pays when per-row COMPUTE is
trivial (replace/repeat/pad/case ops) — for char-iteration ops (get) or regex ops (extract/contains-regex) the
compute dominates and output-boxing removal is ~0-gain. Don't re-attempt typed-output for str.get/extract/
slice_replace. (The `apply_str_opt_utf8` helper + LazyNullableUtf8 path is sound and available if a trivial-
compute null-producing str op ever appears.)

### 2026-06-25 BlackThrush — Series nullable-f64 sum/mean packed-validity scan: 0.78x LOSS->5.43x WIN, 0.75x LOSS->5.88x WIN @1M (bit-identical)
The June 24 surface-dominance checkpoint listed nullable-f64 `Series.sum/mean` as a remaining structural floor:
`sum` walked `validity.get(i)` for every row and `mean` did `count()` plus `sum()`, two branchy validity scans.
The lever adds one `f64_valid_sum_count` primitive over `ValidityMask::packed_words_for_scan()`, consuming set bits
in ascending row order. `sum` uses the returned total; `mean` uses the same one-pass total/count. Bit-identical:
same valid rows, same row-order `0.0`-seeded f64 additions, same all-missing `sum=0.0` and `mean=NaN` contracts.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — composite (Utf8/multi-key) RIGHT merge small-side probe: 0.90x LOSS -> 1.21x WIN @1M⋈10k (bit-identical)
The generic composite merge path (non-i64 keys: Utf8, multi-key, datetime — the i64 Right fast paths at ~7408
don't fire) built a `left_map` over EVERY left row for a Right join (O(left) hash build), then probed it with the
right rows — so a 1M⋈10k Right merge was ~2.4x slower than the SYMMETRIC Left join (which builds the small
O(right) map). Fix: build the small `right_map` (as Inner/Left already do) and run ONE left pass that buckets each
matching left position under its right row (`left_by_right[right_pos].push(left_pos)`), then emit right rows in
order. Bit-identical (right-row order outer, left-position order inner — verified across duplicate right keys,
multiple left matches, and unmatched right rows). Dropped the left_map build entirely for Right (Outer still
builds it). Bench `bench_merge_utf8` 1M fact ⋈ 10k dim, Utf8 key:

| how   | before   | after    | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| right | 231.66ms | 173.65ms | 209.54ms | 0.90x LOSS      | 1.21x WIN      |

(inner 5.30x / left 1.49x / outer 1.22x WINs unchanged.) Right was the LAST merge loss in the Utf8 matrix —
now all four win. Residual: Right (173ms) is still ~1.8x the Left join (97ms) — the per-right bucketing Vecs +
the row_capacity=right_len under-allocation of the output position Vecs (a pre-existing realloc, present in both
old and new) are the remaining gap; a 2-pass pre-size is a follow-up. Correctness: all 135 fp-join tests +
new `utf8_right_merge_smallside_conformance` (2 tests, pandas-verified) green. pandas baseline best-of-6.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — Utf8/mixed multi-key groupby WINS 1.16x but skips the dense bypass (build_groups not avoided) — characterized lever
Probed the documented OPEN "multi-Utf8 groupby" vein. df.groupby([k1_utf8, k2_utf8]).sum/mean/count @1M (g=100 =>
~10k group combos) MEASURED (new bench_gb2_utf8):

| op    | fp      | pandas   | ratio    |
|-------|---------|----------|----------|
| sum   | 90.70ms | 105.21ms | 1.16x WIN |
| mean  | 89.63ms | 103.41ms | 1.15x WIN |
| count | 90.87ms | 105.85ms | 1.16x WIN |

A WIN, but a MARGINAL one — and the cause is a missing dense bypass, not a structural floor. The moments engine
(agg_typed_pairs_dense_f64_moments) bypasses build_groups ONLY for single-Int64 (int64_dense_grouping) and
multi-INT64 (multi_int64_dense_grouping) keys; for any Utf8 key it returns None, so Utf8/mixed multi-key falls
through to the FULL generic build_groups (the 1M per-row Vec<ScalarKey> heap-alloc + composite SipHash — the
documented dominant build_groups cost) AND THEN the dense gid precompute (64329) RE-factorizes the Utf8 columns
to gid_per_row. Two grouping passes; build_groups' is the slow one. LEVER (deferred — quiet box): add a
multi_mixed_dense_grouping() (the factorize-each-Utf8-to-u32 + mixed-radix gid_table already exists at ~64372)
that ALSO emits group_order + the MultiIndex directly, so the moments path skips build_groups for Utf8/mixed
multi-key (mirrors the int64 bypass). EST 90ms -> ~40ms (~2.5x). RISK: bit-identity requires reproducing
build_groups' EXACT sorted group order (composite_key_cmp lexicographic) from the factorize maps + inverse
code->str tables — intricate, golden-gated, shared hot path; NOT safe to iterate on a saturated fleet. The
single-Utf8 dense path (64308) and single/multi-Int64 bypasses already exist; this is the multi-Utf8 sibling.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — multi-Utf8-key groupby dense bypass (build_groups skip): 1.06x->3.74x @1M (bit-identical)
LANDED the lever characterized last commit. Added multi_utf8_dense_grouping (factorize each contiguous-Utf8 key
to first-seen u32 codes + inverse code->str, mixed-radix gid_table, sorted group order) and wired it into the
moments engine (agg_typed_pairs_dense_f64_moments) as the Utf8 sibling of the Int64 dense bypass. For >=2
contiguous-Utf8 keys it SKIPS build_groups (the per-row Vec<ScalarKey> heap-alloc + composite SipHash that
dominated) and feeds moments_by_pair directly. Bit-identical group order: Vec<String>::cmp == composite_key_cmp
for all-Utf8 keys (scalar_key_cmp Utf8 == str::cmp); same ", "-joined flat label + per-level Utf8 MultiIndex as
the generic path. bench_gb2_utf8 1M, g=100 (~10k combos), CONTIGUOUS Utf8 keys (as read_csv/str-ops produce):

| op    | before  | after   | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|-------|---------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| sum   | 99.38ms | 28.16ms | 105.21ms | 1.06x           | 3.74x WIN      | 3.53x   |
| mean  | 92.46ms | 28.39ms | 103.41ms | 1.12x           | 3.64x WIN      | 3.26x   |
| count | 103.77ms| 28.30ms | 105.85ms | 1.02x           | 3.74x WIN      | 3.67x   |

GATE: fires only for CONTIGUOUS Utf8 key columns; a Scalar-backed column (from_values) bails as_utf8_contiguous
and keeps the generic path (so the earlier 90ms "1.16x" reading was a Scalar-backed bench artifact — real Utf8
columns from read_csv/str-ops are contiguous and hit the dense path). Correctness: new
groupby_multi_utf8_dense_conformance proves dense == generic (same data built contiguous-vs-Scalar-backed) ==
pandas (values + sorted MultiIndex order); existing groupby_nullable_dense/fxhash/sgb conformance (17 tests)
green. FOLLOW-UPS: the same multi_utf8 grouping could extend the 4 OTHER multi_int64_dense_grouping call sites
(min/max/first/last/prod/median via aggregate_multi_int64_dense; bool reduce; idxmax/min; nunique) + a mixed
Int64/Utf8 variant. pandas baseline best-of-6.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — multi-Utf8 groupby dense bypass extended to min/max/first/last/prod/median: 1.08x->4.03x @1M (bit-identical)
Follow-up to 61c71a007: wired multi_utf8_dense_grouping into aggregate_multi_int64_dense (the
min/max/first/last/prod/median path), so those funcs ALSO skip build_groups for contiguous-Utf8 multi-keys.
dense_aggregate_emit is grouping-agnostic → reused verbatim; only the Utf8 MultiIndex assembly differs.
bench_gb2_utf8 1M g=100 contiguous Utf8 keys:

| op     | before   | after   | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| min    | 88.41ms  | 24.93ms | 98.36ms  | 1.11x           | 3.95x WIN      | 3.55x   |

Correctness: groupby_multi_utf8_dense_conformance extended to min/max/median (dense == generic == pandas, +
sum/mean/count from the prior commit). REMAINING multi_utf8 sites: try_bool_reduce_dense, try_idx_extreme_dense
(idxmax/idxmin), try_nunique_dense, + a mixed Int64/Utf8 key variant. pandas baseline best-of-6.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — multi-Utf8 groupby dense bypass extended to idxmax/idxmin + nunique: idxmax 1.01x->3.48x @1M (bit-identical)
Further follow-up: added a multi_dense_index_utf8 helper and wired multi_utf8_dense_grouping into
try_idx_extreme_dense (idxmax/idxmin) and try_nunique_dense (the DataFrameGroupBy ones), so they skip
build_groups for contiguous-Utf8 multi-keys. bench_gb2_utf8 1M g=100 contiguous Utf8 keys, f64 values:

| op     | before   | after   | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| idxmax | 104.94ms | 30.39ms | 105.64ms | 1.01x (tied)    | 3.48x WIN      | 3.45x   |

nunique was NOT benchable here (its dense value-bitset needs i64 values; the f64-value bench keeps the generic
path either way — stays ~115ms/1.54x). Its multi_utf8 grouping branch is wired + conformance-verified for the
i64-value case (dense == generic == pandas [2,1]). Correctness: groupby_multi_utf8_dense_conformance now also
covers idxmax (f64, labels [3,2,0,4]) and nunique (i64, [2,1]) dense==generic==pandas; existing
groupby_nullable_dense/fxhash conformance green. REMAINING multi_utf8 site: try_bool_reduce_dense (any/all) +
the mixed Int64/Utf8 key variant. pandas baseline best-of-6.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — multi-key groupby dense bypass generalized to MIXED Int64+Utf8 keys: 1.00x->3.53x @1M (bit-identical)
Generalized multi_utf8_dense_grouping -> multi_mixed_dense_grouping (DenseMultiUtf8Grouping -> DenseMultiMixed
with a MixedKey{Int64,Utf8} enum). Each key column is bounded-Int64 (codes = value-min) OR contiguous-Utf8
(factorize); requires >=1 Utf8 (all-Int64 stays on the faster multi_int64 path). So groupby([int_id, str_cat])
— a common real pattern (e.g. year + category) — now skips build_groups too. Bit-identical: derived MixedKey::cmp
orders per level by value (Int64 i64 cmp, Utf8 str cmp) == scalar_key_cmp, so the sorted group order ==
composite_key_cmp; flat label joins each level's Display (Int64 plain, Utf8 verbatim) == generic. All 4 prior
multi_utf8 call sites (moments sum/mean/count/var/std, aggregate min/max/first/last/prod/median, idxmax/idxmin,
nunique) now use the mixed grouping + a shared multi_dense_index_mixed helper. bench_gb2_mixed 1M g=100 (k1 i64,
k2 contiguous-Utf8, f64 values):

| op  | before  | after   | pandas  | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|-----|---------|---------|---------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| sum | 67.76ms | 20.54ms | 72.49ms | 1.07x           | 3.53x WIN      | 3.30x   |
| max | 65.47ms | 19.89ms | 65.52ms | 1.00x (tied)    | 3.29x WIN      | 3.29x   |

All-Utf8 path unchanged (no regression, ~29ms/3.6x — it is now the all-str case of the mixed grouping).
Correctness: groupby_multi_utf8_dense_conformance extended with a mixed int+utf8 case (dense == generic ==
pandas, incl. NUMERIC k1 sort: (1,x)<(2,x)); existing all-utf8/idxmax/nunique + groupby_nullable_dense/fxhash
conformance green. The multi-Utf8/mixed groupby vein is now complete except try_bool_reduce_dense (any/all).

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — multi-column duplicated/drop_duplicates typed raw path (Int64+Utf8): 2.55x->3.75x @1M (bit-identical)
The multi-column duplicated_mask had a typed raw-digest path only for ALL-Float64 subsets; any Int64/Utf8/mixed
subset fell to the generic Scalar-digest path (a per-cell `col.values()[row]` materialization — a String alloc
per Utf8 cell). Generalized typed_cols from f64-only to a TypedDedupCol{F64,I64,Utf8} enum, so any subset of
Int64 + contiguous-Utf8 + Float64 columns digests/compares straight from the raw backing. Bit-identical: the
per-type digest mixes match scalar_digest exactly (Int64 mix(2)+value; Utf8 mix(4)+len+bytes_digest; Float64
mix(3)+bits, same present rule) and equality matches Scalar::semantic_eq (Int64/Utf8 exact, Float64 fuzzy) — so
digests, bucket assignment, and collision re-verification are unchanged. bench_dropdup_multi 1M, 2 contiguous-
Utf8 cols, card=100:

| op             | before  | after   | pandas  | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|----------------|---------|---------|---------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| drop_duplicates| 30.39ms | 20.61ms | 77.36ms | 2.55x           | 3.75x WIN      | 1.47x   |
| duplicated     | 27.13ms | 17.81ms | 81.19ms | 2.99x           | 4.56x WIN      | 1.52x   |

Already a WIN; this strengthens it by removing the Scalar materialization for Int64/Utf8/mixed subsets.
Correctness: new duplicated_multicol_typed_conformance (typed contiguous vs Scalar-backed == generic == pandas
across keep=First/Last/None); existing fxhash_dedup_conformance green.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — multi-key OUTER merge 0.55x LOSS (root-caused) + standing bench; fix deferred (golden-gated, no-fallback)
Probed multi-key (2 Utf8) merge via new bench_merge2_utf8 (1M fact ⋈ 100×100 dim, contiguous Utf8 keys). Measured
vs pandas 2.2.3 (best-of-8):

| how   | fp       | pandas   | ratio     |
|-------|----------|----------|-----------|
| inner | 158.58ms | 176.06ms | 1.11x WIN |
| left  | 154.67ms | 188.07ms | 1.22x WIN |
| outer | 785.06ms | 435.03ms | 0.55x LOSS |

Inner/left marginal wins; OUTER is a clear LOSS (the documented residual, now reproduced for multi-key — single-
key outer wins 1.22x). ROOT CAUSE (read, not guessed): the composite merge path (~7629) materializes left_keys
(1M) + right_keys as Vec<CompositeJoinKey> = SmallVec<[JoinKeyComponent;1]> where Utf8 = IndexLabel::Utf8(String);
then for needs_key_order (sort|Outer) `push_merge_row_key` CLONES one CompositeJoinKey PER OUTPUT ROW (~1M SmallVec
allocs + 2M String clones) into out_row_keys, which sort_merge_rows_by_join_keys (already a factorize+counting
sort) then hashes. CONTAINED LEVER: drop out_row_keys entirely — have sort_merge derive each row's key by
reference from the positions (key_ref(i) = left_positions[i].map(|p| &left_keys[p]).unwrap_or(&right_keys[
right_positions[i]])), bit-identical (matched rows use the left key today, unmatched-right use the right key).
Requires MOVING the sort into the key-building block (left_keys/right_keys are block-local), i.e. modifying the
golden-gated outer-sort path with NO fallback — distinct from the additive groupby dense bypass, so unsafe to
one-shot on a saturated fleet. FULLER LEVER: factorize join keys to integer codes once (khash-style, like
multi_mixed_dense_grouping) and run the join + sort + reindex on codes, never materializing CompositeJoinKey —
helps inner/left too. Both deferred to a quiet box with fast iteration + the merge goldens.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — DataFrame.value_counts dense fast path (Int64/Utf8 contiguous): 0.50x LOSS -> 3.63x WIN @1M (bit-identical)
df.value_counts() (distinct row-tuple counts) was a LOSS: the generic path built a per-row Vec<ScalarKey> + a
per-cell `col.values()[i]` Scalar materialization + `value.to_string()` (a String alloc per cell, twice). Added
an ADDITIVE value_counts_dense_contiguous fast path: when every column is bounded-Int64 or contiguous-Utf8 (all-
valid) with bounded combined cardinality, factorize each column + dense gid-table count, then emit the same
`count desc, composite_key_cmp asc` order and `", "`-joined labels. Any other dtype / missing column / wide
cardinality falls back to the generic path. Bit-identical: MixedKey::cmp == composite_key_cmp and MixedKey
Display == Scalar Display for Int64/Utf8; all-valid backings ⇒ no missing key class; count ties resolve by the
same composite key (distinct, so the stable sort's first-seen tiebreak never fires). bench_df_vc 1M, 2
contiguous-Utf8 cols, card=100:

| op              | before   | after   | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|-----------------|----------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| df.value_counts | 209.39ms | 28.88ms | 104.85ms | 0.50x LOSS      | 3.63x WIN      | 7.25x   |

Correctness: new df_value_counts_dense_conformance (typed contiguous vs Scalar-backed == generic == pandas,
count desc + composite-key tiebreak); existing fxhash_dedup green. The contiguous-key factorize lever (groupby +
dedup + now value_counts) keeps flipping composite-key ops from Scalar-materialization losses to ~3-7x wins.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — GroupBy.size dense bypass for >=2 keys: 1.72x->3.68x @1M (bit-identical)
df.groupby([k1,k2]).size() already won 1.72x but still went through build_groups (per-row Vec<ScalarKey>) for
its sole cost. Added a dense fast path: for >=2 keys, multi_int64_dense_grouping / multi_mixed_dense_grouping
gives gid_per_row; histogram it for the per-group count and build the same ", "-joined multi-key labels (the
generic group_key_label format) in the same sorted-key order. Flat Index, no MultiIndex — exactly what the
generic size returns. bench_gb2_utf8 1M g=100 contiguous Utf8 keys:

| op   | before  | after   | pandas  | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|------|---------|---------|---------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| size | 56.94ms | 26.64ms | 98.06ms | 1.72x           | 3.68x WIN      | 2.14x   |

Already a WIN; this strengthens it (build_groups was its whole cost). Correctness: groupby_multi_utf8_dense_
conformance extended with size (dense == generic == pandas, sorted-key order); existing 4 cases green.

### 2026-06-25 BlackThrush — Series Bool mask direct typed gather: 1.25x LOSS->1.35x WIN vs pandas @2M (bit-identical)
Followed the 2026-06-25 residual above: `Series::filter(mask_series)` and `Series::loc_bool(&[bool])` still
materialized a `Vec<usize>` positions buffer, then gathered the Int64 index and Int64 payload in separate
generic passes. The new path recognizes all-valid Bool masks over Int64-labelled, all-valid Int64/Float64
Series and emits typed labels + typed payload in one mask scan; duplicate-index, nullable-mask, non-typed, and
aligned fallback semantics stay on the existing paths. This is the selection-vector/rank-select lever from the
graveyard: carry the mask witness straight to dense output construction instead of first expanding it to row
ids.

BOLD head-to-head on CPU 7, warmed target dir `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`,
per-crate only (`cargo build --release -p fp-frame --example bench_loc_bool`), 2M rows / 999,998 kept:

| case | before | after | pandas | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|------|--------|-------|--------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| `filter_series` | 5.459ms | 2.754ms | 3.737ms | 1.25x LOSS | 1.35x WIN | 1.98x |
| `loc_bool` | 5.019ms | 2.740ms | 3.737ms | 1.34x LOSS | 1.36x WIN | 1.83x |

Golden stayed `0e95636b5d230bf5` across baseline and after runs. A first after run showed allocator noise
(`filter_series` 6.045ms), but two immediate same-binary reruns stabilized at 2.956ms and 2.820ms, and the
100-iteration confirmation was 2.754ms. The pandas comparator used the same mixed-hash mask and pandas Series
index/mask alignment shape.

Post-rebase release rebuild confirmation on the final source: `loc_bool=2.793ms`, `filter_series=3.149ms`,
pandas aligned Series bool mask `4.244ms` (pandas 2.2.3), preserving the `filter_series` 1.35x WIN and
strengthening `loc_bool` to 1.52x on that run.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — GroupBy.value_counts contiguous-Utf8 span tally: 0.72x LOSS -> 3.38x WIN @1M (bit-identical)
df.groupby(k).value_counts() was a LOSS: the per-group value tally did `col.values()[ri]` PER ROW (materializing
the value column to Scalars — a String alloc per row) keyed through a ScalarKey-keyed std HashMap (SipHash).
Added a span fast path: when the value column is contiguous Utf8 (all-valid), tally each group by raw &[u8] span
with FxHash, rebuilding Scalar::Utf8 once on first sight. Bit-identical: all-valid ⇒ no missing to skip, first-
seen order = same row iteration, stable count-desc sort unchanged. Falls back to the ScalarKey path for any other
dtype / missing value column. bench_gb_vc 1M, gcard=100 vcard=100, contiguous Utf8 k+v:

| op               | before   | after   | pandas   | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |

Correctness: new gb_value_counts_span_conformance (span vs Scalar-backed == generic == pandas, per-group count
desc + first-seen tiebreak). The contiguous-key/span lever (groupby agg+size, dedup, df.value_counts, now
GroupBy.value_counts) keeps flipping Scalar-materialization losses to ~3-7x wins. RESIDUAL: build_groups by the
GROUP key (k) is still the Vec<ScalarKey> path — a fuller (k,v) dense factorize could push this higher.

### 2026-06-25 BlackThrush — multi-Utf8 GroupBy all/any mixed dense bypass: 1.03x->3.30x @1M (bit-identical)
Finished the remaining multi-Utf8/mixed groupby dense-bypass site called out above: `DataFrameGroupBy::all()` /
`any()` had the single-key and multi-Int64 dense path, but a contiguous-Utf8 or mixed Int64+Utf8 key still fell
back to `build_groups` before doing the typed truthy fold. The new branch reuses `multi_mixed_dense_grouping()`
and `multi_dense_index_mixed()`, then runs the existing sequential Bool/Int64/Float64 truthiness reducer over
`gid_per_row`. Behavior is unchanged: group order is the same sorted mixed key order used by the generic path,
Bool truthiness is identity, numeric truthiness is `!= 0` / `!= 0.0`, and nullable or non-typed value columns
still fall back.

BOLD head-to-head on CPU 7, warmed target dir `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`,

| any | 90.795ms | 30.129ms | 104.510ms | 1.15x WIN | 3.47x WIN | 3.01x |

Correctness: `groupby_multi_utf8_dense_conformance::bool_reduce_dense_matches_generic_and_pandas` covers
contiguous-Utf8 dense vs Scalar-backed generic output for both `all` and `any`, including Bool and Int64
truthiness under pandas sorted group order.

Post-rebase release rebuild confirmation on the final source: `all=27.623ms`, `any=26.951ms` against the same
pandas 20-run comparator above, strengthening the final ratios to 3.62x and 3.88x vs pandas.

### 2026-06-25 BlackThrush — fp-join RIGHT UTF-8 borrowed-byte position builder: 0.76x LOSS -> 0.34x LOSS (REVERTED)
Tried the symmetric all-valid UTF-8 right-join position builder: build a left `FxHashMap<&[u8], positions>`,
walk right keys in right order, and feed `(left_positions, right_positions)` into the existing dense right merge
materializer. The hypothesis was that right joins were missing the borrowed-byte fast paths already present for
inner/left/outer UTF-8 joins and were falling through to cloned `JoinKeyComponent::Utf8` keys. It was
bit-transparent on paper (same all-valid guard, same right-row order, same left bucket order, same unmatched-right
row emission), but the measured path got worse.

Bench shape: `bench_merge_utf8`, `n=1_000_000`, `card=10_000`, `how=right`, best-of-8, crate-scoped
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a rch exec -- cargo run -p fp-join --example
bench_merge_utf8 --release -- 1000000 10000 8 right`. Pandas 2.2.3 comparator used the same key generator and
`left.merge(right, on="key", how="right")`.

| path | timing | ratio |
|------|--------|-------|
| pandas | 168.390ms | 1.00x |
| current fp baseline | 220.872ms | 0.76x vs pandas |
| UTF-8 right-position candidate | 501.244ms | 0.34x vs pandas; 0.44x vs current fp |

REVERTED. Do not retry this isolated right-position builder. The residual is not solved by wrapping another
borrowed-byte position vector around `build_single_key_dense_right_merge_output`; it needs deeper output-side work
or a right-join materializer that avoids optional-position duplication and repeated key/payload gathers.

### 2026-06-25 BlackThrush — Series Int64 Bool-mask direct-compress helper superseded: 1.01-1.03x vs main (REVERTED)
After `origin/main` landed the broader `Series Bool mask direct typed gather` path above, a narrower
`Index::take_bool_i64_values` + `Series::filter_int64_by_bool_mask` helper no longer had a credible measured
edge. It preempted the main path for all-valid Int64 Series, but handled only Int64 payloads while the main path
also covers Float64 and already emits typed labels plus values in one pass for the benchmark shape.

Same-worker RCH comparison on `hz2`, warmed target dir
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a`, crate-scoped
`cargo run -p fp-frame --example bench_loc_bool --release -- 2000000 30`, golden
`0e95636b5d230bf5` unchanged:

| path | origin/main | candidate | candidate/main |
|------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| `Series::loc_bool(&[bool])` | 2.786ms | 2.713ms | 1.03x |
| `Series::filter(mask_series)` | 2.804ms | 2.777ms | 1.01x |

REVERTED before landing. Treat this as noise-level/superseded, not a new lever. Keep using the broader main-path
typed gather unless a future benchmark proves a separate cold lazy-affine or mixed-selected-label case with a
real same-worker delta and no loss of Float64 coverage.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — multi-key merge sort: drop per-row CompositeJoinKey clone (ranks by reference): outer ~16% faster, 0.55x->~0.65x (still LOSS, bit-identical)
Attacked the documented biggest gap (multi-key OUTER merge 0.55x). The composite merge path cloned one String-
owning CompositeJoinKey PER OUTPUT ROW (~1M SmallVec + 2M String) into out_row_keys, purely to feed the
factorize+counting sort. Replaced it: sort_merge_rows_by_join_keys now takes left_keys/right_keys + the position
arrays, derives each row's key BY REFERENCE (matched/unmatched-left -> left key, unmatched-right -> right key —
exactly what out_row_keys stored), factorizes left∪right to dense ranks, and counting-sorts. The sort moved
in-block (where left_keys/right_keys are in scope); push_merge_row_key now no-ops. Bit-identical: same per-row
key, same cmp-ordered ranks (over a superset -> empty buckets), same stable emission — all 135 fp-join tests +
utf8_outer_merge_sort_conformance green.

bench_merge2_utf8 1M ⋈ 100×100, 2 contiguous-Utf8 keys, CONTROLLED interleaved (before-vs-after back-to-back on
the same machine load, min of 4 pairs): outer before 822ms -> after 691ms = ~16% faster (consistently 16-24%
per pair). vs pandas 435ms: ~0.53x -> ~0.63x — STILL A LOSS, but the biggest gap is reduced and a real smell
(1M key clones) removed. inner/left unaffected (they don't sort). RESIDUAL: the loss is now dominated by the
CompositeJoinKey MATERIALIZATION (collect_composite_keys, 1M left) + outer column reindex; a flip needs the
fuller factorize-join-keys-to-int-codes lever (join/sort/reindex on codes, never materializing CompositeJoinKey)
— deferred (bigger restructure of the whole composite path).

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — GroupBy.first/last Utf8-key dense path: 0.41x LOSS -> 6.98x WIN @1M (bit-identical)
df.groupby(k_utf8).first()/last() was a big LOSS: try_first_last_dense required an as_i64_slice KEY, so a Utf8
key bailed to aggregate_named_func's generic build_groups + per-group Scalar gather (materializing the value
column). Added a contiguous-Utf8 key branch: factorize the key (FxHash &[u8] -> codes + inverse), sort gids by
key string (sort=True), build the Utf8-labelled named Index — then the EXISTING chosen-row + take_positions
(zero-copy, value-type-agnostic) gather runs unchanged, so a Utf8 (or any) value column is gathered without
Scalar materialization. Falls back to the generic path for a non-Int64/Utf8 key or a null-bearing value column.
bench_gb_first 1M, gcard=100, contiguous Utf8 k + Utf8 v:

| op    | before   | after   | pandas  | before->pandas | after->pandas | fp-side |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| first | 180.75ms | 10.48ms | 73.21ms | 0.41x LOSS      | 6.98x WIN      | 17.2x   |
| last  | 179.58ms | 11.01ms | 76.94ms | 0.43x LOSS      | 6.99x WIN      | 16.3x   |

Correctness: new gb_first_last_utf8_dense_conformance (contiguous-key dense == scalar-backed generic == pandas,
first/last row per group, sorted-key index); existing groupby_nullable_dense + multi_utf8_dense conformance
green (the Int64-key path is preserved — its gate just moved inside the new key-type branch).

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — GroupBy.max/min Utf8-value dense path: 1.33x->11.81x, 1.38x->13.67x @1M (bit-identical)
groupby(k).max()/min() over a Utf8 value column was only a marginal WIN (pandas object aggregation is slow): the
numeric dense_aggregate_emit can't reduce Utf8, so it fell to the generic build_groups + per-group Scalar gather.
Added try_minmax_str_dense (single key Int64/Utf8 factorize): per group, the argmax/argmin ROW is found by &[u8]
span comparison, then take_positions (zero-copy, value-agnostic) gathers it — same lever as first/last. Bit-
identical: gathered value IS the group's lexicographic max/min string; sorted-key index. bench_gb_first 1M
gcard=100 contiguous Utf8 k+v: max 179.35->20.14ms (1.33x->11.81x vs pandas, 8.9x fp-side), min 180.87->18.29ms
(1.38x->13.67x, 9.9x). conformance gb_first_last_utf8_dense extended (max/min dense==generic==pandas); first/last
+ int64 min/max unaffected.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — LEDGER REJECT: Series abs 0.36x / cumsum 0.93x @5M — arc-copy-on-produce floor (structural blocker)
Re-measured the biggest gap-vs-pandas. Series.abs @5M f64: fp 63.20ms vs pandas 22.54ms = 0.36x LOSS. cumsum:
fp 65.68ms vs pandas 60.96ms = 0.93x (marginal LOSS). CAUSE (documented f64-arc-copy-on-produce): all f64 storage
is Arc<[f64]>; producing a Vec<f64> output then from_f64_values does Arc::from(Vec) = a 40MB REALLOC+COPY. abs is
|x| (trivial compute) so it is dominated by traffic: ~120MB (read 40 + Vec write 40 + Arc copy 40) vs pandas ~80MB
-> 0.36x. NO contained fix: Arc<[f64]> requires the copy (ArcInner-prefix layout); avoiding it needs storing f64
as Arc<Vec<f64>> (move, no copy) — a deep type change cascading through the slice-sharing variants
(LazyAllValidFloat64Slice/Dot/Strided share Arc<[f64]> for zero-copy take_positions) — OR an additive
Float64Owned(Arc<Vec<f64>>) variant whose as_f64_slice returns &v[..]. The additive variant is COMPILER-GUIDED
(exhaustive ScalarValues matches -> every site is a compile error to fix, no silent bugs) but ~44 arms + golden-
risky; deferred to a quiet box with fast iteration. in-place (Arc::get_mut) doesn't apply: abs(&self) shares the
input Arc. REJECTED zero-gain attempts: none tried (structural). This is the standing biggest gap.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — GroupBy.nunique Utf8-value span path: 1.05x->2.29x @1M (bit-identical)
groupby(k).nunique() over a HIGH-cardinality Utf8 value was only marginally winning (1.05x): the (group,value)
bitset in try_nunique_dense needs bounded-Int64 values, so a wide-cardinality Utf8 value blew the cell cap and
the generic path materialized a Vec<Scalar> per group + nannunique. Added try_nunique_str_dense (single Int64/
Utf8 key factorize): one pass inserts each row's &[u8] value span into a per-gid FxHash set; the set size is the
group's distinct count — no Scalar materialization, no build_groups. Bit-identical: all-valid (no missing to
skip), distinct spans == distinct Utf8 values, sorted-key index. bench_gb_first 1M gcard=100 high-card Utf8 v:
nunique 188.66->86.81ms (1.05x->2.29x vs pandas, 2.17x fp-side; residual = the inherent 1M-distinct-span hashing,
same as pandas' 198ms). conformance gb_nunique_str_dense (span vs Scalar-backed == generic == pandas); first/last
+ low-card-i64 nunique unaffected.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — SeriesGroupBy max/min Utf8-value dense span: 1.43x->18.6x @1M contiguous (bit-identical)
v.groupby(by).max()/min() over a CONTIGUOUS-Utf8 value: agg_values_scalar's dense-bucket path still materializes
every value Scalar and clones it into a per-gid bucket, then utf8_extreme scans each bucket. Added
try_utf8_extreme_dense: ONE pass tracks each gid's lexicographic max/min &[u8] span directly (no values() Scalar
Vec, no buckets). Bit-identical: same dense_group_ids first-seen gids/labels agg_values_scalar uses, same str-cmp
extreme (span byte-cmp == str cmp), same index name. bench_sgb_str 1M gcard=100, CONTROLLED interleaved (min of
3 pairs, contiguous v): max 185->14.2ms = 13x fp-side, vs pandas 264.68ms 1.43x->18.6x WIN; min similar. (A
Scalar-backed value from from_values bails -> agg_values_scalar; real Utf8 columns from read_csv/str-ops are
contiguous.) conformance sgb_utf8_extreme_dense: dense == generic (both first-seen) for all fixtures, == pandas
for sorted-order data. SeriesGroupBy.first already fast (7x); this completes the SeriesGroupBy Utf8 extreme path.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — multi-key GroupBy.first/last Utf8-value dense: 0.61x LOSS->4.75x WIN @1M (bit-identical)
try_first_last_dense was single-key only (by.len()==1), so groupby([k1,k2]).first()/last() over a Utf8 value
bailed to the generic build_groups + per-group Scalar gather — a LOSS. Extended it to >=2 keys via
multi_int64_dense_grouping / multi_mixed_dense_grouping (+ multi_dense_index[_mixed] for the row-MultiIndex); the
chosen-row + take_positions (zero-copy, value-agnostic) gather and the value/null gates are unchanged. Bit-
identical: same sorted-key group order, same first/last chosen row, same flat label + per-level MultiIndex.
bench_gb2_str 1M gcard=100 contiguous Utf8 k1,k2 + Utf8 v: first 228.76->29.51ms (0.61x->4.75x vs pandas, 7.76x
fp-side), last similar. (max/min multi-key Utf8 v are already WINS — pandas object max is slow, 2.5-2.8x.)
conformance gb_first_last_multikey (dense==generic==pandas, sorted MultiIndex); single-key first/last/max/min +
multi_utf8 agg unaffected.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — REFINED abs/arc-copy blast radius: 44 exhaustive ScalarValues::LazyAllValidFloat64 sites + ~dozens of `_ =>` wildcards (all fp-columnar)
Measured the additive-Float64Owned-variant blast radius for the standing biggest gap (Series.abs 0.36x arc-copy
floor). 44 LazyAllValidFloat64 match sites, ALL in crates/fp-columnar/src/lib.rs (contained to one crate — good).
BUT the file has 203 `_ =>` wildcard arms; a new f64 variant would be compiler-flagged at the 44 exhaustive sites
(mechanical, mirror LazyAllValidFloat64) yet SILENTLY hit wildcards at many others (correct-but-slow at best,
mishandled-as-Eager at worst). Confirmed: this needs the 44 edits + an audit of every f64-adjacent wildcard +
the FULL fp-columnar/fp-frame conformance run to catch silent bugs — a quiet-box task with fast iteration, NOT a
safe saturated-fleet 60m one-shot (a half-applied variant would leave broken/incorrect f64 handling). Standing
biggest gap; concrete next lever fully scoped.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — SeriesGroupBy.nunique Utf8-value span: 0.92x LOSS->2.60x WIN @1M contiguous (bit-identical)
v.groupby(by).nunique() over a CONTIGUOUS-Utf8 value was a marginal LOSS: agg_values_scalar materializes every
value Scalar into a per-gid bucket then a FxHashSet<ScalarKey>. Added SeriesGroupBy try_nunique_str_dense (sibling
of the DataFrameGroupBy one): a single pass inserts each row's &[u8] value span into a per-gid FxHash set; the set
size is the distinct count — no Scalar Vec, no buckets. Bit-identical: all-valid (no missing to skip), distinct
spans == distinct Utf8, same dense_group_ids first-seen gids/labels, same name. bench_sgb_str 1M gcard=100 high-
card contiguous Utf8 v: 224.22->79.06ms (0.92x->2.60x vs pandas, 2.84x fp-side). conformance
sgb_nunique_str_dense (dense==generic both first-seen; ==pandas for sorted-order); SeriesGroupBy max/min/first
unaffected.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — GroupBy.count dense (all-valid => group size): 0.36x LOSS->5.77x WIN @1M (bit-identical)
groupby(k).count() over a Utf8 (or any) value column was a big LOSS: the generic aggregate_named_func("count")
materializes the value column to Scalars to check is_missing per row. But count is just the non-null tally, and
an all-valid column has no nulls => count == group SIZE — which needs only the grouping, no value access. Added
try_count_dense (single Int64/Utf8 or multi-key factorize, sibling of try_first_last_dense): histogram gid_per_row,
emit the per-group size as the Int64 count for every value column. Bit-identical: same sorted-key order/MultiIndex,
Int64 counts. Value-type-AGNOSTIC (covers Utf8/Int64/Float64 values); falls back for a null-bearing value column or
non-dense key. bench_gb_first 1M gcard=100 contiguous Utf8 k+v: count 178.65->11.03ms (0.36x->5.77x vs pandas,
16.2x fp-side). conformance gb_count_dense (single + multi key, dense==generic==pandas).

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — GroupBy.agg(dict/list) over Utf8 routes to dense methods: count 0.35x->5.42x, first 0.42x->6.91x @1M (bit-identical)
agg_typed_pairs (behind agg_list / agg(dict)) built its per-func reductions by calling aggregate_named_func(func)
DIRECTLY — which SKIPS the public gb.<func>() dense gates (try_count_dense / try_first_last_dense /
try_minmax_str_dense). So agg({'v':'count'}) / agg(['first']) over a Utf8 value was ~3x SLOWER than the direct
gb.count()/.first()/.max() despite those being fixed. One-line-per-func fix: dispatch count/first/last/min/max
through the public methods (others keep aggregate_named_func). Bit-identical: each dense path is proven equal to
its aggregate_named_func result (the gb_*_dense conformances), so by_func is unchanged, just faster.
bench_gb_agglist 1M gcard=100 contiguous Utf8 v: count 174.60->11.39ms (0.35x->5.42x, 15.3x fp-side), first
174.87->10.51ms (0.42x->6.91x), max ~15.5ms. conformance gb_agglist_str (agg_list == direct gb.<func>() ==
pandas); groupby_nullable_dense + gb_count_dense green.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — measured WINS (don't re-probe): sort_values(utf8) 11-13x, df.idxmax/idxmin 1.28-1.58x, SeriesGroupBy.value_counts 3.68x @1M
Dominance confirmation while loss-hunting: DataFrame.sort_values by a contiguous-Utf8 col fp 94-108ms vs pandas
1199-1267ms = 11-13x WIN (str MSD-radix dominates pandas object sort); DataFrame.idxmax/idxmin axis=0 over 10 f64
cols 7.4-7.5ms vs pandas 9.5-11.9ms = 1.28-1.58x WIN; SeriesGroupBy.value_counts high-card Utf8 485ms vs pandas
1787ms = 3.68x WIN. All WINS — not losses. abs/cumsum arc-copy floor remains the sole standing structural gap.

### 2026-06-25 SlateOtter — GroupBy.transform over Utf8: first 0.19x->1.32x, max 0.66x->5.27x, count 0.25x->5.09x @1M (bit-identical)
GroupBy.transform(first/last/max/min/count) over a Utf8 value was a big LOSS: try_transform_dense handled only
f64/i64 value columns (the final arm is `col.as_i64_slice()?` — returns None for Utf8, bailing the whole
transform to the generic build_groups + per-row Scalar gather). Added a contiguous-Utf8 broadcast arm: count ==
group SIZE (all-valid); first/last/min/max pick a representative ROW per gid (first/last/argmin/argmax by &[u8]
span) and broadcast that span to every row — no Scalar materialization. Bit-identical: transform broadcasts per
row so gid order is irrelevant; count==size for all-valid; span byte-cmp == str cmp. var/std/median/etc. on Utf8
return None (generic, as before). bench_sgb_str 1M gcard=100 contiguous Utf8 v: first 403.04->58.49ms
(0.19x->1.32x, 6.89x fp-side), max 410.23->51.09ms (0.66x->5.27x), count 250.03->12.16ms (0.25x->5.09x).
conformance gb_transform_str (dense==generic==pandas, broadcast); numeric transform unaffected (Utf8 arm only
fires for as_utf8_contiguous columns). SeriesGroupBy.transform delegates here, so it inherits the fix.

### 2026-06-25 BlackThrush — GroupBy.transform_list (Utf8): first 0.21x->1.40x, count 0.28x->5.08x @1M (bit-identical)
transform_list(['first','count',...]) (behind df.groupby(k).transform([...])) still did its OWN build_groups +
per-group Vec<Scalar> gather + apply_agg_func per (col,func) — so it never reached the dense f64/i64/Utf8 broadcast
fast paths that the public transform() entry got in 938b7b5e0. Over a Utf8 value it was ~0.2x pandas. Fix: compute
each DISTINCT func once via self.transform(func) (which fires try_transform_dense), then relabel its columns
{col} -> {col}_{func} in the same col-major order. Bit-identical by construction: transform() reproduces the exact
same per-group apply_agg_func broadcast in its fallback arm (and its dense arm is proven == fallback by the
gb_transform_str / groupby_nullable_dense conformances), and the {col}_{func} column_order is built by the same
nested loop as before. Distinct funcs are memoized so transform([f,f]) calls transform(f) once. bench_gb_first 1M
gcard=100 contiguous Utf8 k+v: tflist(first) 363.51->54.27ms (0.21x->1.40x vs pandas 75.76ms, 6.70x fp-side),
tflcount(count) 214.19->11.83ms (0.28x->5.08x vs pandas 60.04ms, 18.1x fp-side). lib tests transform_list (2) +
groupby_transform (13) green.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — composite OUTER merge borrowed sort keys: 0.60x->0.85x vs pandas @1M (partial keep, residual loss)
No unlanded measured `.scratch` / `.worktrees` win was found on the current `origin/main` scan: the stale
`set_index(drop=true)` retained-column clone worktree hunk is already represented on main by the
`DataFrame::set_index(drop=true)` ledger entry and commit, and the remaining dirty worktree files are either
bench artifacts or peer-owned stale probes. Dug the documented largest current gap instead: multi-key OUTER
merge (`bench_merge2_utf8`, 1M fact rows, 100x100 Utf8 dimension keys).

Root: the generic sorted/composite merge path already factorized the output keys for counting-sort, but it first
cloned one full `CompositeJoinKey` per emitted output row into `out_row_keys`. On a two-Utf8-key OUTER merge this
means roughly 1M extra `SmallVec` writes plus 2M `String` clones before sort ranking. The new path keeps the
existing `left_keys` / `right_keys` arrays for hash/probe, then derives each output row's sort key by borrowing
through `(left_position, right_position)`: matched and left-only rows use `left_keys[left_pos]`, right-only rows
use `right_keys[right_pos]`. Rank order and stable row order are unchanged, so the output is bit-identical to the
old cloned-key sorter.

Bench evidence, per-crate only, warmed `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`:
`rch exec -- cargo bench -p fp-join --no-run` passed the bench-profile build gate; `cargo bench --release` is not
a Cargo-valid flag, so timing used the standing release driver
`rch exec -- cargo run -p fp-join --example bench_merge2_utf8 --release -- 1000000 100 8 outer`. FP baseline and
candidate both ran on `vmi1227854`; pandas 2.2.3 comparator used the same generated key distribution, best-of-8.

| path | timing | ratio vs pandas |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| pandas | 342.852ms | 1.00x |
| current fp baseline | 574.727ms | 0.60x LOSS |
| borrowed-position-key sorter | 405.099ms | 0.85x LOSS |

Result: **1.42x fp-side improvement** and the measured ratio improves from 0.60x to 0.85x, but OUTER merge still
does not beat pandas. KEEP PARTIAL because this is not zero-gain and removes the exact cloned-key cost called out
in the previous root-cause note; residual work is now output materialization / shared-key column rebuild, not the
sort-key clone ledger.

Correctness / gates: `cargo check -p fp-join --all-targets`; `cargo clippy -p fp-join --all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings`; `cargo test -p fp-join merge_composite_outer -- --nocapture`; `cargo test -p fp-join --test
utf8_outer_merge_sort_conformance -- --nocapture`; `cargo test -p fp-conformance
conformance_merge_outer_sort_true_with_suffixes -- --nocapture`; `cargo test -p fp-conformance
live_oracle_dataframe_merge_outer_basic -- --nocapture`. The two `fp-conformance` tests compiled and passed but
skipped live pandas assertions because this detached worktree has no `legacy_pandas_code/pandas` oracle root.
`rustfmt --check crates/fp-join/src/lib.rs` is clean; full `cargo fmt -p fp-join --check` still reports
pre-existing unrelated formatting diffs in `bench_merge2_utf8.rs` and `utf8_right_merge_smallside_conformance.rs`,
which were not touched or staged.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — DataFrame.set_index contiguous Utf8: 0.29x LOSS->1089x WIN @100k (bit-identical)
df.set_index("a", drop=true) over an all-valid contiguous-Utf8 column still allocated one `String` per row and
built a materialized `IndexLabel::Utf8` vector before returning. Added an ownership-preserving
`Column::utf8_contiguous_arcs()` bridge and route that case into `Index::from_utf8_contiguous`, reusing the same
immutable byte/offset backing and deferring label materialization until `Index::labels()` is requested. Bit-
identical: the column branch is gated on all-valid contiguous Utf8; the lazy index materializes the same
`IndexLabel::Utf8` strings; index name/drop behavior is unchanged; nullable or scalar-backed Utf8 still uses the
old fallback; `verify_integrity=true` still calls `has_duplicates()`.

Evidence on current origin/main f31428283 with CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a:
baseline fp-frame bench_set_index utf8/drop n=100000 iters=30 best 2,034,371ns; candidate best 541ns (3760.4x
fp-side). pandas 2.2.3 comparator for the same operation/size: best 589,399ns, so ratio vs pandas moved from

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy sem/skew/kurt over Utf8 key: sem 0.69x->2.31x, skew 0.84x->2.73x, kurt 1.45x->5.34x @1M (bit-identical)
SeriesGroupBy std/var already had a Utf8-key dense path (dense_group_var_std uses dense_group_ids, which handles
Int64 + contiguous-Utf8 + scalar-backed-Utf8 keys), but sem/skew/kurt routed through group_moment_dense whose key
gate was `self.by.column.as_i64_slice()?` — Int64-ONLY. So a Utf8-keyed sem/skew/kurt bailed to agg_values_scalar
(materialize a Vec<Scalar> per group, then nansem/nanskew/nankurt over Scalars): sem 58.63ms (0.69x pandas), skew
49.81ms (0.84x). Fix: rebuild group_moment_dense on dense_group_ids() (the proven dense_group_var_std grouping) and
construct each gid's label from ki(Int64)/ku(contiguous-Utf8) in first-seen order, identical to dense_group_var_std.
The Int64 branch is bit-identical (dense_group_ids yields the same first-seen gid order the old i64 histogram did;
same ascending-row sum, same powi moments, same finalize). f64-value-only + Int64/contiguous-Utf8-key-only as
before; nullable value or scalar-backed key still bails to agg_values_scalar.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — Series.str.slice routes to contiguous apply_str_utf8: 1.31x->6.64x vs pandas @1M (bit-identical)
A full str.* sweep (1M contiguous Utf8) found the whole accessor surface already dominates pandas (len 12.7x,
contains 124x, count 5.9x, splitget 5.7x, upper/lower/title/capitalize/zfill/replace 2-3.4x) — EXCEPT str.slice at
1.31x, the last string-PRODUCING op still on the slow apply_str path: it built a Vec<Scalar::Utf8> (a 32-byte enum
+ an owned String per row) then re-packed via Column::from_values. Its peers (lower/upper/zfill/title/capitalize/
strip/replace) already route through apply_str_utf8, which writes each row's bytes into ONE rolling buffer + offsets
(zero Scalar materialization; for a contiguous input it transforms byte ranges in place). Converted slice's closure
to (write: &str,&mut Vec<u8> | fallback: &str->Scalar): the write arm appends the forward-ASCII byte span directly
(no owned String) and reuses python_slice_chars for the general step/non-ASCII arm; the fallback preserves the
Scalar-backed / missing-value path. Bit-identical: identical sliced bytes at every slot.

Bench, per-crate only, CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc, bench_str_probe 1M
contiguous-Utf8, pandas 2.2.3 same data best-of-6: str.slice(0,5) fp 79.49ms -> 15.68ms (5.07x fp-side); pandas

(2) asserts contiguous-input (zero-copy branch) == scalar-backed-input (write/fallback branch) bit-for-bit across
forward-ASCII / negative / step / reverse / multi-byte-char cases and that scalar nulls are preserved; lib str_slice
+ str_slice_negative_and_step + slice_replace + series_str_slice_golden_basic (5) green. (replace was already on
apply_str_utf8; its 2.10x is the inherent per-row s.replace temp-String cost, not a slow-path artifact.)

### 2026-06-26 cod-pandas — composite OUTER merge shared Utf8 key coalesce: 0.85x/near-parity -> 1.03x vs pandas @1M (bit-identical)
Scanned `.scratch` / `.worktrees` first: no measured worktree commit was ahead of current `origin/main`; stale
`set_index(drop=true)` hunks were already represented by the landed `set_index` commit, and remaining dirty files
were bench artifacts or peer-owned stale probes. Dug the standing multi-key OUTER merge residual from the
BlackThrush borrowed-sort-key entry instead.

Root: after sort-key cloning was removed, the generic composite OUTER merge still rebuilt each same-name shared key
column via `Vec<Scalar>`: every output row cloned either `left_key_col.values()[pos]` or `right_key_col.values()[pos]`
into an owned `Scalar::Utf8(String)`, then `Column::from_values` repacked it. The new helper is a narrow fast path
for all-valid contiguous Utf8 shared key columns: it coalesces left/right positions directly into one contiguous
byte buffer plus offsets, preserving the same row-order source rule (`left` when present, otherwise `right`) and
falling back to the old Scalar path for nullable, scalar-backed, mixed-type, or impossible `(None,None)` rows.

Bench evidence, per-crate only, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a`, current main
checkout source to avoid detached-worktree shared-target artifact confusion:
`rch exec -- cargo bench -p fp-join --no-run` passed. `cargo bench --release` is not a Cargo-valid flag, so timing
used the standing release driver
`rch exec -- cargo run -p fp-join --example bench_merge2_utf8 --release -- 1000000 100 32 outer`.

Earlier uncontended local samples were noisier (`main` 423.654ms, candidate 402.135ms, pandas 424.061ms; then
candidate 354.932/438.656ms, pandas 407.859/448.604ms), but the conservative recorded comparison still flips the
standing OUTER merge residual over pandas and gives a same-window 1.77x fp-side improvement versus the measured
main baseline. Correctness: new unit guard
`merge_composite_outer_contiguous_utf8_key_coalesce_matches_scalar_route_blackthrush` verifies the contiguous fast
path matches the scalar-backed generic route for matched, left-only, and right-only rows and keeps contiguous Utf8
storage for both shared keys. Gates: `rch exec -- cargo bench -p fp-join --no-run`; `rch exec -- cargo clippy -p
fp-join --all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings`; `rch exec -- cargo test -p fp-join merge_composite_outer --

`rustfmt --check crates/fp-join/src/lib.rs`; `git diff --check`. `timeout 180s ubs crates/fp-join/src/lib.rs`
completed with the known broad fp-join inventory (0 critical; warning count 4756 after fixing the focused
direct-indexing report in the new helper); remaining sample warnings point at pre-existing lines outside this hunk.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — Series.dt.* surface fully dominates pandas (floor/ceil/normalize "losses" were machine-load PHANTOMS — DON'T re-chase)
Probed the entire typed (i64-backed Datetime64) .dt accessor @1M (new reproducible example bench_dt_probe):
year 1.28x, month 1.16x, day 1.13x, hour 2.37x, minute 2.46x, second 2.34x, dayofweek 2.66x, quarter 1.18x,
dayofyear 1.04x, is_month_end 1.41x, days_in_month ~1.0x, date 1.65x, round 6.1x, strftime 4.63x — ALL WINS.
A FIRST pandas batch reported floor 2.96ms / ceil 2.88ms / normalize 6.23ms, which looked like fp LOSSES
(0.30x/0.30x/0.62x vs fp ~10ms). Those pandas reads were MACHINE-LOAD PHANTOMS: this box was under heavy peer
load (rch refused remote slots — "no admissible workers / active_project_exclusion" — during the same window).
Clean apples-to-apples re-measure with the EXACT fp splitmix data, best-of-10, same machine moments later:
pandas floor 12.03ms, ceil 11.95ms, normalize 14.47ms vs fp floor 10.03ms / ceil 10.36ms / normalize 9.95ms =
floor 1.20x, ceil 1.15x, normalize 1.45x WINS. The typed round_to_freq fast path already reads as_datetime64_slice,
snaps via snap_datetime_ns (one rem_euclid/elem), and emits from_datetime64_values — it is at parity-to-winning
with pandas' numpy libdivide modulo and is memory-bound, NOT a real loss. NO source change; bench committed for
reproducibility. LESSON (again): re-confirm any sub-1.0x .dt read with a clean best-of-N on a quiet box before
treating it as a lever — the first batch's 2.96ms floor was the phantom, not the signal.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — Timedelta64 loc[[labels]] batch resolver (deferred mirror): 0.042x LOSS -> 4.2x WIN @200k⋈20k (bit-identical)
The identity-cached `loc[[labels]]` batch resolvers existed for Int64 / Utf8 / Datetime64 keys
(unsorted_unique_int64_positions / unique_utf8_positions / unique_datetime64_positions), but Timedelta64 was the
documented DEFERRED mirror: a `loc[[td]]` on a unique TimedeltaIndex fell to the duplicate-aware per-call
`FxHashMap<&IndexLabel, Vec<usize>>` rebuild over the WHOLE index (the pointer-key pathology), so it was 24x
SLOWER than pandas (which caches its index engine). Added the exact sibling: a process-global
`INDEX_TIMEDELTA_POS_LOOKUP_CACHE` keyed by the index's runtime `label_identity`,
`timedelta64_position_lookup_cached` (first-occurrence ns->position table; `Timedelta64(i64)` is ns-backed so it
reuses the Int64 table type), and `Index::unique_timedelta64_positions`, wired into BOTH loc call sites
(Series + DataFrame) AND `get_indexer_for` (reindex/align/join core). Bit-identical: the index is unique here so
first-occurrence == only-occurrence == the pointer-key map's answer; a duplicate or non-Timedelta64 index returns
None and keeps the unchanged duplicate-aware fallback; missing labels fail closed identically.

| fp after (identity-cached resolver) | 0.213ms | 4.2x WIN (~100x fp-side) |

Correctness: new conformance td_loc_conformance (4) — unique-TD fast path payload == same selection over an Int64
index, duplicate-TD index returns all matches ascending (slow path), missing fails closed, warm-cache repeated
calls stable; fp-frame loc lib tests (96) + fp-index positions/get_indexer (25) green. Mirrors the Datetime64 fix
(recbe, 1173x->67x) — same pathology, same lever.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — REJECT: Index.union over Utf8 is a string-hash-dedup (khash) floor — 0.55x, contiguous-output zero-gain
Probed the Utf8-keyed Index set-op surface @200k (new bench_idx_utf8_isin). Findings: isin 7.74x WIN (58.00ms
pandas / 7.49ms fp — pandas object isin is slow; fp's pointer-key fallback still wins, no fix needed),
intersection 4.29x WIN (already has the &str fast path), difference/symmetric_difference already carry Utf8 &str
fast paths. The ONE loss is Index.union over Utf8: fp ~24ms vs pandas ~13.5ms = 0.55x (stable best-of-6 x3 both
sides, same data). union_with already has a Utf8 &str fast path (FxHashSet dedup, self-then-other first-occurrence).
ROOT: the cost is the n+m FxHashMap<&str> dedup over the scattered Scalar-backed label strings, NOT the output —
pandas hashes the concatenation with khash then SORTS and still beats fp's no-sort dedup, i.e. fp's string dedup
alone is ~4x slower than pandas' khash unique. This is the documented khash floor for strings (sister to the
wide-i64 high-card khash floor). ATTEMPTED LEVER (REVERTED, zero-gain): emit the unique labels straight into a
contiguous byte buffer + offsets via Index::from_utf8_contiguous instead of cloning a String per unique label into
Vec<IndexLabel> + Self::new — bit-identical, but 24ms -> ~22ms (within noise), proving the per-String output clone
is NOT the bottleneck; the input-side &str dedup dominates. SECOND control: re-ran with CONTIGUOUS-Utf8-backed
inputs (Index::from_utf8_contiguous, as read_csv produces) — union is still ~24.6ms, backing-INDEPENDENT, so
neither labels() materialization nor the output clone is the cost: it is purely the n+m string dedup. A real fix
needs a custom open-addressing string table (inline hash + offset, cache-friendly) to beat khash — a large,
golden-risky change, DEFERRED. Bench committed for reproducibility; no source change landed. DON'T re-chase the
contiguous-output idea or the labels()-materialization idea — both disproven by measurement.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — Index.union over Datetime64/Timedelta64: 0.58x LOSS -> 1.18x WIN @200k (bit-identical)
Probed Datetime64 index set-ops (time-series alignment) @200k (new bench_idx_dt_setops): intersection 5.8x WIN +
difference 6.2x WIN (both use the sorted-merge two-pointer, which already covers AscendingDatetime64) and isin
1.6x WIN — but union was 0.58x (10.48ms vs pandas 6.10ms). union_with has NO sorted-merge path (its contract is
self-then-other FIRST-OCCURRENCE order, not pandas' sorted — see utf8_setops oracle_union), and its only typed
fast paths were int64_view (IndexLabel::Int64 only) and Utf8; Datetime64/Timedelta64 (also ns-backed but a distinct
label variant) fell to the pointer-key FxHashMap<&IndexLabel> rebuild. Fix: extract the ns when every label is the
temporal variant and route through the proven union_i64 (dense-bitset / FxHashSet<i64>, first-occurrence dedup),
then rebuild via from_datetime64 / from_timedelta64. Bit-identical: union_i64 yields the exact self-then-other
first-occurrence ns sequence the pointer-key path would, just with inline i64 keys instead of enum-pointer probes;
empty inputs return None so the degenerate empty-union dtype stays the fallback's.

Correctness: new conformance dt_union_conformance (4) — Datetime64 + Timedelta64 union match the first-occurrence
oracle (incl. a reverse-sorted case proving output is NOT globally sorted), empty self/other edges keep the other
side, output carries the matching temporal dtype; fp-index union/setop tests (31) green. (Datetime/Timedelta
isin/intersection/difference already WIN — no change; this was the lone union gap.)

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — UNSORTED Datetime64/Timedelta64 Index intersection/difference/symdiff: 0.37-0.57x LOSS -> 1.0-2.5x WIN @200k (bit-identical)
Follow-up to the Datetime64 union fix. For SORTED temporal indexes intersection/difference/symdiff already WIN via
the sorted-merge two-pointer (covers AscendingDatetime64), but for UNSORTED temporal indexes (after concat / take /
non-monotonic construction) sorted-merge bails and — like union — int64_view's Int64-only gate left them on the
pointer-key FxHashMap<&IndexLabel> rebuild: intersection 0.37x, difference 0.57x, symdiff 0.48x pandas. Added an
all_temporal_ns(labels, datetime) extractor + Datetime64/Timedelta64 branches (after the int64 path) that reuse the
proven membership_filter_i64 (dense-bitset / FxHashSet<i64>) over the ns and rebuild via from_datetime64 /
from_timedelta64. Bit-identical: same self-order first-occurrence kept/dropped labels (symdiff = two disjoint
keep_present=false halves), inline i64 keys instead of enum-pointer probes; SORTED indexes still take sorted-merge
first (no regression, re-verified 0.6ms). Empty inputs bail to the fallback.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — Datetime64/Timedelta64 Index dedup family (nunique/unique/duplicated/drop_duplicates/value_counts): 0.49-0.69x LOSS -> 1.2-1.6x WIN @200k (bit-identical)
Continuing the temporal-index pointer-key sweep (set-ops done prior). The dedup family had Int64 fast paths
(int64_view + nunique_i64 / unique_i64 / duplicated_i64 / value_counts_raw_i64) but no temporal sibling, so a
Datetime64 index fell to the cloned/pointer-key FxHashMap<IndexLabel>: nunique 0.52x, unique 0.49x, value_counts
0.58x, duplicated 0.66x, drop_duplicates 0.69x pandas. Added a NaT-gated `temporal_ns_present(datetime)` extractor
and routed all five through the existing i64 kernels, rebuilding the temporal dtype for the index-returning ops and
relabeling Int64->Datetime64/Timedelta64 for value_counts. NaT-GATED: each op has distinct NaT semantics
(dropna-exclude / keep-one / treat-as-value) that the generic fallback already encodes, so any NaT bails there;
a no-NaT temporal index reuses the kernels where a present timestamp behaves exactly like any i64. Bit-identical.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — UNSORTED Datetime64/Timedelta64 Index argsort/sort_values via argsort_i64: 0.57x LOSS -> 1.45-1.88x WIN @200k (bit-identical)
Continuing the temporal-index sweep. argsort/sort_values had Int64 fast paths (int64_view + argsort_i64) but no
temporal sibling, so an UNSORTED Datetime64 index fell to a comparison sort that derefs into the IndexLabel vector
per compare (argsort 0.57x, sort_values 0.58x pandas). Added Datetime64/Timedelta64 branches that radix/stable-key
argsort the raw ns via argsort_i64 and (for sort_values) gather + rebuild the temporal dtype. Bit-identical:
IndexLabel derives Ord so Datetime64/Timedelta64 compare by inner i64 (NaT==i64::MIN sorts FIRST in both paths),
and both argsort_i64 (sort_by_key) and the fallback (sort_by) are STABLE, so duplicate-timestamp ties keep input
order identically — NO NaT gate needed (sorting treats a present and a NaT timestamp consistently across paths).

plus an Int64-path differential; sort/argsort tests (17) green. (factorize 1.22x + get_indexer_non_unique 14.8x over
datetime already WIN — pandas is slow there — so no change; this completes the temporal Index op surface.)

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — Series.nunique over a Datetime64 column: 0.47x LOSS -> 1.47x WIN @200k (bit-identical); value_counts/unique/dup partial
Probed Series dedup-family ops over a Datetime64 VALUE column @200k (new bench_series_dt_dedup): as_i64_slice is
DType::Int64-gated, so a ns-backed Datetime64 column missed every typed fast path and fell to .values()+ScalarKey+

nunique: an all-valid no-NaT Datetime64 column counts distinct ns via FxHashSet<i64> (sibling of the sparse Int64

== distinct timestamps. bench_series_dt_dedup nunique 4.31->1.39ms = 0.47x->1.47x WIN (3.1x fp-side). Conformance
series_dt_dedup (2: distinct-count differential + NaT-bail) + nunique lib (26) green.

REVERTED (not a clean win this pass): value_counts datetime tally got the hash tally to nunique speed (~1.4ms) but
value_counts stayed 0.47x (13.62->8.80ms, 1.55x fp-side) because it is OUTPUT-materialization-bound — the shared
post-tally `Index::new(labels)` + `Column::from_values(counts)` over ~50k Scalar pairs dominates, and the tie-order
of the stable desc sort is subtler than a plain first-seen oracle (the typed tally did not match my oracle, so I
pulled it rather than land an unverified + still-losing change). A clean fix needs a TYPED Datetime64-index +
Int64-count output path (bypassing the Scalar materialization) — DEFERRED, golden-risky on the shared output path.
unique/duplicated/drop_duplicates over Datetime64 remain measured losses (0.47-0.60x), same as_i64_slice gate —
follow-up (light-output ops like duplicated should flip cleanly like nunique).

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — Series.duplicated/drop_duplicates over Datetime64 column: 0.47-0.60x LOSS -> 1.35-1.54x WIN @200k (bit-identical); unique partial
Follow-up to the nunique-Datetime64 win. Same as_i64_slice Int64-gate left duplicated/drop_duplicates/unique over a
Datetime64 VALUE column on the .values()+ScalarKey+SipHash path. Added duplicated_flags_datetime64_hash(keep) — a
FxHashSet<i64> hash sibling of the dense duplicated_flags_i64_direct (the ns span is too wide for the dense table) —
shared by BOTH duplicated() and drop_duplicates_keep(); plus a Datetime64 sparse branch in unique(). All gated
all-valid + no-NaT (i64::MIN bails to the generic dropna/keep path). Bit-identical: same first/last/none keep rule on
the same ns keys; drop_duplicates gathers the same kept rows through the typed ns buffer + from_datetime64.

Bench, per-crate only, bench_series_dt_dedup n=200000 Datetime64 ~n/4 distinct, pandas 2.2.3 best-of-6:

| unique (partial)| 4.99ms | 3.01ms | 2.37ms | 0.47x -> 0.79x | 1.66x |

unique KEPT as a partial (non-zero-gain, verified): the per-row ScalarKey is gone, but unique() returns Vec<Scalar>
so ~50k Scalar::Datetime64 output boxes remain — an output floor (same shape as the value_counts output floor); it
can't beat pandas' typed datetime64 array without an API change. Correctness: conformance series_dt_dedup (4 now:
nunique distinct + NaT-bail + duplicated oracle + unique/drop_duplicates first-occurrence oracle) + duplicated/
drop_duplicates/unique lib (45) green. Completes the Series-over-Datetime64 dedup family except the two output-bound
ops (value_counts, unique), which need a typed-output path (deferred).

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — Series dedup family over a Timedelta64 column: 0.50-0.92x LOSS -> 1.26-1.84x WIN @200k (bit-identical)
Timedelta64 sibling of the Datetime64 Series dedup wins. Same as_i64_slice Int64-gate left nunique/duplicated/
drop_duplicates/unique over a Timedelta64 VALUE column on .values()+ScalarKey+SipHash. Extracted the dup-flags
core to duplicated_flags_over_i64(data, keep) (shared by the datetime + new timedelta helpers) and added
Timedelta64 branches (as_timedelta64_slice + FxHashSet<i64>, NaT==i64::MIN bails) to nunique/duplicated/
drop_duplicates/unique. Bit-identical: same first/last/none + first-occurrence rules on the same ns keys; outputs
carry Timedelta64 dtype. ALL FOUR flip cleanly (unique's milder pre-loss + the typed Column::new backing keep it
above 1.0x here, unlike the Datetime64 unique partial).

Bench, per-crate only, bench_series_td_dedup n=200000 Timedelta64 ~n/4 distinct, pandas 2.2.3 best-of-6:

Correctness: new conformance series_td_dedup (2: first-occurrence oracle for nunique/duplicated/unique/
drop_duplicates + NaT-bail) + dedup-family lib (71, incl. unchanged Datetime64 conformance after the shared-core
refactor) green. Remaining Series-over-temporal loss: value_counts (both dtypes, output-materialization floor —
deferred).

### 2026-06-26 cod-a — Series.value_counts over Datetime64: 0.36x LOSS -> 2.15x WIN @200k; Timedelta64 sibling still loss
Follow-up verification after `addcab6af` landed the typed temporal value_counts materializer on main. Current
`origin/main` already routes all-valid Datetime64/Timedelta64 Series.value_counts through an i64-ns `FxHashMap`
tally and typed temporal index labels, avoiding the old `column.values()` + `ScalarKey` + string-label output
path. BOLD-VERIFY datetime on the same `rch` worker (`vmi1227854`) flips cleanly: current-main baseline before the
typed output path was 11.108 ms versus pandas 3.974 ms (0.36x); after `addcab6af` the same bench is 1.846 ms
versus pandas 3.974 ms (2.15x, 6.0x FP-side). Focused guard:
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a rch exec -- cargo test -p fp-frame series_value_counts_temporal_labels_are_typed_cod_a_vctmp -- --nocapture`
green; per-crate bench build gate
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a rch exec -- cargo bench -p fp-frame --no-run`
green.

Measured Timedelta64 sibling is NOT a pandas win and should not be claimed closed: after the same typed path,
`bench_series_td_dedup 200000 value_counts` measured 10.811 ms versus pandas 3.999 ms (0.37x) on `vmi1264463`.
Do not spend another wrapper pass here; the remaining Timedelta64 value_counts gap is still output/index
materialization and needs a deeper TimedeltaIndex/Series output primitive.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — groupby(Datetime64/Timedelta64 key) generic-path index labels now TYPED (correctness fix)
The groupby-by-temporal-key PERF win (0.23x->~5x via temporal_sparse_grouping/aggregate_temporal_sparse + a typed
value_counts) was landed by a peer in addcab6af — I independently reached the same lever this cycle, so only my
unique delta remains. That delta: `group_key_label` (the GENERIC build_groups label builder, used by the funcs the
peer's dense temporal path does NOT cover — nunique/sem/skew/kurt/idxmax/size/... per group) mapped a Datetime64/
Timedelta64 key to `Utf8(format!("{:?}"))` = a stringified "Datetime64(..)" index label instead of pandas' typed
DatetimeIndex. Added typed `IndexLabel::Datetime64(v)`/`Timedelta64(v)` arms (5 lines). Now ALL single-key
datetime/timedelta groupby funcs (dense + generic) carry a typed temporal index, matching pandas. No existing
test/golden locked the old Utf8-debug labels. New conformance gb_dtkey (3): Datetime64/Timedelta64-key groupby
(incl. generic-path nunique) DIFFERENTIAL vs the Int64-key path over the same ns (group order + values match,
index typed) + NaT drops the NaT group (dropna default); groupby lib (202) + groupby conformances (9) green.

### 2026-06-26 cod-a — Timedelta64 Series.value_counts direct count-column attempt REJECTED; fresh main is already 2.20x pandas
Fresh BOLD-VERIFY on the same 200k / 50k-card deterministic Timedelta64 Series workload showed the prior
Timedelta64 loss row above was stale/noisy rather than a current gap. Current `origin/main` measured
`series_td_value_counts n=200000: best=1899105ns` via
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a rch exec -- cargo run -p fp-frame --example bench_series_td_dedup --release -- 200000 value_counts`;
RCH selected `vmi1227854`. Live pandas 2.2.3 on the matching generator measured 4.170 ms, so current main is
2.20x pandas.

Attempted NEW lever: keep temporal `value_counts` counts as `Vec<i64>` and return `Column::from_i64_values`
directly instead of materializing `Vec<Scalar::Int64>` before `Column::from_values`. Correctness guard
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a rch exec -- cargo test -p fp-frame series_value_counts_temporal_labels_are_typed_cod_a_vctmp -- --nocapture`
passed (RCH failed open locally, still per-crate). Candidate timing was
`series_td_value_counts n=200000: best=2702259ns`, or 1.54x pandas but 0.70x versus current main. Source was
reverted as zero-gain/regression; ledger-only reject.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — REJECT: Timedelta64 Series.value_counts direct count-column is noise/regression vs fresh main
Independent cod-b BOLD-VERIFY repeated the same direct count-column idea after rebasing over the cod-a reject and
the fresh `origin/main` median commit. The candidate kept temporal `value_counts` counts in a typed Int64 column
instead of building `Vec<Scalar::Int64>`, but same-mode local repeats were unstable and failed the keep bar:
candidate 3.107 ms / 3.524 ms versus fresh-main 3.323 ms / 3.189 ms for
`bench_series_td_dedup 200000 value_counts` with
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`. The final paired comparison was candidate
3.524 ms vs main 3.189 ms = 0.90x FP-side; using cod-a's matching pandas 2.2.3 timing of 4.170 ms, candidate is
still 1.18x pandas but worse than main's 1.31x in the same pair. RCH selected remote `vmi1264463` for fresh main
and measured 6.260 ms, but candidate remote admission failed open locally, so cross-mode remote/local numbers are
routing evidence only, not proof. Source hunk was skipped from the rebase; ledger-only reject.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — DataFrame.median(axis=1): 1.32x -> 5.17x vs pandas @500k×20 (bit-identical)
A full axis=1 reduction sweep (500k rows × 20 f64 cols) confirmed the surface is dominated — sum 2.4x, mean 2.8x,
min/max 2.5x, std 8.8x, var 8.6x, skew 8.3x, count 234x WINS — EXCEPT median, the softest at 1.32x and the lone
axis=1 op still on the slow reduce_rows (per-row Scalar gather) AND doing a full per-row sort. Routed it through the
typed reduce_rows_func_f64 (gather the column f64 slices once, no Scalar) + QUICKSELECT (select_nth_unstable_by —
median needs only the middle order statistic(s), O(k) avg vs O(k log k); even count takes the max of the left
partition as the lower-middle). Bit-identical to the full-sort closure for non-NaN rows (same two middle values);
a NaN/missing or non-Float64 frame returns None and keeps the generic per-row path.

Bench, per-crate only, CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc, bench_axis1 n=500000 ncols=20
all-f64, pandas 2.2.3 best-of-6: median 428.65ms -> 109.15ms (3.9x fp-side); pandas 564.54ms, so 1.32x -> 5.17x.
Correctness: new conformance median_axis1_conformance (quickselect == full-sort oracle for ncols 1/2/3/7/8/20/21,
duplicate-heavy + negative rows) + median_axis lib (1) green. (The other axis=1 reductions already WIN — no change.)

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — Series transforms sweep: cumulative f64 = arc-copy floor (don't re-chase); pct_change/clip/rank/shift WIN
Probed Series transforms @1M f64 (new bench_stransform). WINS: pct_change 12.6x (1.76ms vs 22.28ms — pandas' is
slow), clip 1.61x (13.6 vs 21.9ms), rank 4.0x (45.7 vs 182.9ms), shift 1.11x. LOSSES (apparent): cumsum/cummax/
cummin/cumprod ~0.33-0.52x, diff ~0.40x. Verified the typed prefix-scan path IS firing (as_f64_slice covers the
from_f64_values LazyAllValidFloat64 backing; cumsum runs `data.iter().scan(acc).collect::<Vec<f64>>()` +
from_f64_values, NOT the Scalar path). So the residual is the DOCUMENTED f64 arc-copy-on-produce floor
(from_f64_values -> Arc::from(Vec) reallocates+copies the 8MB output; see "f64 Arc copy-on-produce" memory, prior
quiet-box reading 0.86x). The 0.33-0.52x here is that floor AMPLIFIED by heavy box contention this session (298s
example builds; cumsum best-of-6 varied 9.3-12.5ms run-to-run; load avg high). A direct-Arc<[f64]>-build (Arc::
new_uninit_slice + fill, avoiding the Vec->Arc realloc) saves only the ~1ms copy and still would not cross 1.0x;
the real fix is the deferred Vec-backed/Arc<Vec<f64>> ScalarValues variant (structural fp-columnar, peer-contended).
DON'T re-chase on a loaded box. No source change. bench committed for quiet-box re-verification.

### 2026-06-26 cod-a — DataFrame all/any(axis=1) typed Bool output: all 0.65x LOSS -> 1.95x WIN, any 7.93x WIN
Fresh BOLD-VERIFY on 500k x 10 all-valid Float64 frame, matching `bench_df 500000 10 30` generator, found
`DataFrame.all(axis=1)` was still losing to pandas solely through Bool output materialization. Live pandas 2.2.3:
`all(axis=1)` 5.861 ms, `any(axis=1)` 5.587 ms. Current-main FP with the new bench lane:
`all_axis1=9046396ns`, `any_axis1=5151824ns` (all 0.65x pandas; any 1.08x pandas).

Kept lever: the typed all-Float64 fast paths now collect raw `bool` values and emit
`Column::from_bool_values` directly instead of constructing `Vec<Scalar::Bool>` and re-inferring through
`Column::from_values`. This is behavior-identical under the existing gate: every input column is an all-valid,
no-NaN Float64 slice, so the old scalar truthiness arm is exactly `v != 0.0`, and the output is an all-valid Bool
Series with the same index/name. Candidate timing:
`all_axis1=3003191ns`, `any_axis1=704397ns`; ratios are all 1.95x faster than pandas and 3.01x FP-side faster,
any 7.93x faster than pandas and 7.31x FP-side faster. Focused guards:
`cargo test -p fp-frame all_axis1 -- --nocapture` and `cargo test -p fp-frame any_axis1 -- --nocapture` green
(RCH failed open locally, still per-crate).
### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — REJECT/zero-gain: multi-col df.duplicated/drop_duplicates with a Datetime64 subset is ALREADY a WIN
Suspected a loss: duplicated_mask's TypedDedupCol (the typed multi-col dedup digest) covers F64/I64/Utf8 but NOT
Datetime64/Timedelta64 (as_i64_slice is Int64-gated), so a temporal column in the subset falls to the generic
per-cell Scalar digest. Added Datetime64/Timedelta64 TypedDedupCol variants (digest tag 5/6 + ns, exact i64
equality, gated all-valid no-NaT — bit-identical to scalar_digest). MEASURED before/after under the SAME (loaded)
box via stash toggle, bench_dedup_dtsubset n=1M subset=[id i64, ts Datetime64]: duplicated 13.5ms BEFORE vs 16.3ms
AFTER (within noise, NOT faster); drop_duplicates 66.4 vs 67.8ms. ZERO-GAIN — REVERTED. Why: fp's generic
Scalar-digest dedup is dominated by the digest/RowBucket logic, not the per-cell Scalar materialization, so the
typed-temporal input doesn't move the needle; and the op ALREADY WINS — pandas duplicated(subset) 71.4ms /
drop_duplicates(subset) 108.2ms are slow, so fp is 5.3x / 1.6x FASTER regardless. DON'T re-chase the temporal
TypedDedupCol idea; multi-col dedup is dominated. bench committed for reproducibility.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — str.extract WINS 1.31x (regex-bound); cumulative-f64 ~0.5x is arc-copy floor, NOT index-clone
Quiet-box (load ~12) dig over reshaping + transforms. (1) df.melt is fully typed (i64/f64 id-tiling, contiguous-
Utf8 variable col, f64 value-concat) — dominated, no change. (2) Series.str.extract(regex) @1M contiguous Utf8:
fp 220.3ms vs pandas 287.79ms = 1.31x WIN. It uses the slow apply_str (Vec<Scalar::Utf8>+from_values) rather than
apply_str_utf8, BUT it's regex-ENGINE-bound (~200ms in re.captures per row), so the output-path lever would save
only ~15ms (220->~205ms, 1.31x->1.4x) — marginal, not worth the null-bearing contiguous complexity; already a win.
(3) Cumulative-f64 (cumsum/cummax/cummin/cumprod ~0.5x, diff 0.67x) RE-MEASURED on the quieter box: still ~8.5ms
(cumsum) vs pandas 4.2ms. RULED OUT the index-clone hypothesis — a lazy unit-range Int64 index (O(1) clone,
matching pandas RangeIndex) gives the SAME 8.6ms as a materialized Index::new(Vec) (8.5ms). So it is the documented
f64 arc-copy-on-produce floor (from_f64_values -> Arc::from(Vec) realloc) PLUS a ~3ms residual the arc-copy alone
(~1ms) doesn't explain; a direct-Arc<[f64]> build (unsafe new_uninit_slice) saves only the ~1ms copy and won't
cross 1.0x. The real fix stays the deferred Vec-backed/Arc<Vec<f64>> ScalarValues variant (structural fp-columnar).
bench_str_extract + bench_stransform (now defaults to a pandas-fair unit-range index; pass "mat" for materialized)
committed for reproducibility. No source change (the temporal-TypedDedupCol attempt last cycle was zero-gain).

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — ROOT-CAUSE + spec: f64 arc-copy floor is Arc::from(Vec) fresh-alloc faults = ~5.7ms (NOT ~1ms); Vec-move variant = ~3-4x lever (the biggest remaining gap)
Decomposed cumsum @1M f64 on a quiet box (load ~9) with isolation probes in bench_stransform (rawscan = prefix-sum
into a Vec only; rawscan_arc = that + Arc::from(out); cumsum = full): rawscan 0.71ms, rawscan_arc 6.47ms, cumsum
8.2ms. So Arc::from(Vec<f64>) costs ~5.7ms — ~70% of cumsum — and the prefix-scan is only 0.71ms. This OVERTURNS
the prior "arc-copy ~1ms / contention-inflated" reading: the cost is a FRESH 8MB Arc<[f64]> allocation copied from
the Vec each call, dominated by first-touch PAGE FAULTS on the cold buffer (the source Vec is warm/allocator-reused
across iters; the Arc buffer is freed+re-allocated cold every call). ~1.4 GB/s effective confirms fault-bound, not
bandwidth-bound.

THE LEVER (move-not-copy): add ScalarValues::LazyAllValidFloat64Vec { data: Arc<Vec<f64>>, .. } and make
Column::from_f64_values build it via Arc::new(vec) (MOVES the warm buffer — no fresh alloc, no copy, no faults);
as_f64_slice returns &data[..]. Estimated cumsum ~8.2ms -> ~2ms = 0.5x -> ~2x pandas; FLIPS the whole f64-produce
family (abs 0.35x, cumsum/cummax/cummin/cumprod ~0.5x, diff 0.67x, clip — all arc-copy-bound). This is the single
biggest remaining gap vs pandas.

BLOCKER (why not landed this cycle): the change touches 41+ exhaustive ScalarValues match sites (to_scalars/len/
validity/clone/every accessor) in fp-columnar, which is HOT and PEER-CONTENDED (active concurrent commits). Adding
a variant there in a 60-min shared-checkout window risks rebase conflicts + a missed arm across the full f64
conformance surface. Needs a DEDICATED, non-contended fp-columnar pass (or the fp-columnar owner). Isolation bench
committed (bench_stransform rawscan/rawscan_arc) so the win can be re-confirmed and the variant landed surgically.
No source change this cycle (the prefix-scan itself is already optimal at 0.71ms).

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — LANDED the f64 arc-copy lever: cumsum/cummax/cummin 0.5x -> 4.8-7.3x WIN @1M (bit-identical, conformance GREEN)
Executed the move-not-copy lever spec'd last cycle (Arc::from(Vec) = ~5.7ms cold-fault-bound copy). Added
ScalarValues::LazyAllValidFloat64Vec { Arc<Vec<f64>> } (semantically identical to LazyAllValidFloat64, all-valid)
+ Column::from_f64_values_owned (MOVES the hot output Vec via Arc::new — no realloc/copy/faults; NaN-bearing output
routes to the unchanged from_f64_values Arc path, since NaN must mark missing). Routed cumsum/cummax/cummin/cumprod
outputs through it. Surgically scoped: general from_f64_values stays Arc<[f64]> so the take_positions/binary/finite-
witness zero-copy fast paths (which key on that variant) are UNAFFECTED — the 4 ScalarValues exhaustive matches
(as_slice/len/clone) + as_f64_slice got the new arm.

Isolation probe confirmed: rawscan_arc (Arc::from copy) 8.08ms vs rawscan (Vec only) 0.71ms — the ~5.7ms was the

failed. FOLLOW-UP (infra now landed, each a 1-line from_f64_values->from_f64_values_owned): abs (0.35x, the worst),
clip, diff, and other all-valid-f64-producing ops.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — extend f64 move-not-copy to the typed-float-unary family: sign 0.07x->1.47x WIN, abs 0.02x->~parity (43-51x fp-side), bit-identical
Follow-up to the cumsum/cummax move-not-copy win: routed Column::from_f64_all_valid_with_finite_opt (the all-valid
f64 producer used by abs/fabs/sign + typed_float_unary => sqrt/exp/log/sin/cos/floor/ceil/...) through the owned
Vec move (Arc::new, witness-carrying) instead of lazy_all_valid_float64_with_finite's Arc::from(Vec) cold-realloc-
copy. Caller contract is all-valid (no NaN), so the move is always safe here — no NaN scan. Bit-identical (same
all-valid values + all_finite witness).

Bench, per-crate only, bench_stransform 1M f64, pandas 2.2.3 best-of-8:

abs's residual is pandas' SIMD vfabs (0.17ms) vs fp's scalar map — now compute-bound, the arc-copy catastrophe
(fp was 50x SLOWER) is gone. Conformance GREEN: fp-columnar 436, fp-frame lib 3103, 0 failed. NEW finding (separate
path, follow-up): Series.round(decimals) is 14.4ms vs pandas 0.56ms = 0.039x — a slow per-element round-compute

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — Series/Column.round(decimals): 0.039x -> 0.090x (2.3x fp-side, arc-copy removed); residual = round_ties_even libcall (SIMD-rint lever, golden-risky)
round's f64 path was 14.36ms (the previously-flagged biggest gap): `(x*factor).round_ties_even()/factor` then
from_f64_values' Arc::from(Vec) cold-realloc-copy. Routed it through from_f64_values_owned (move) — round of all-
valid finite/inf is never NaN, so bit-identical. bench_stransform 1M decimals=2: 14.36 -> 6.24ms (2.3x fp-side);
pandas 0.56ms, so 0.039x -> 0.090x. Conformance GREEN: fp-columnar 436, fp-frame round lib 29 + conformance
binaries, 0 failed. RESIDUAL (still 11x pandas): the ~5.9ms is the per-element f64::round_ties_even, which does NOT
auto-vectorize here (confirmed: splitting into numpy-style mul;rint;div passes measured 6.0ms == fused, so it's a
libcall per element, not a fusion/div issue) — pandas uses SIMD rint (roundpd). Flipping it needs a vectorized
round-to-nearest-even (magic-number (y+2^52)-2^52 with copysign + |y|<2^52 select, OR explicit roundpd via
std::simd), whose tie/>=2^52/subnormal/-0.0 bit-identity is NOT fully covered by current goldens — DEFERRED to a
dedicated pass with an exhaustive differential test vs round_ties_even. (floor/ceil/trunc share the libcall risk.)

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — typed_float_unary generic+move: exp 1.32x->2.26x WIN; floor/ceil/trunc/round/sqrt are a SIMD BUILD-TARGET blocker
typed_float_unary (backs sqrt/exp/log/sign/rint/cbrt) took a `fn(f64)->f64` POINTER (indirect call per element, no
inline, no vectorization) and used from_f64_values' Arc::from(Vec) copy. Made it generic <F: Fn> (monomorphizes +
inlines, like its finite_preserving sibling) + from_f64_values_owned (move; NaN outputs route to the identical
NaN-as-missing path). Bit-identical. Conformance GREEN: fp-columnar 436, fp-frame 145, 0 failed.
Bench bench_stransform 1M: exp 18.15->10.65ms = 1.32x -> 2.26x WIN (pandas 24.03ms; arc-copy removed + inline).

BLOCKER (the biggest remaining math-unary gaps are NOT source-fixable): floor 0.089x (2.13 vs 0.19ms), ceil 0.11x,
trunc 0.13x, round(decimals) 0.090x, sqrt ~0.085x, log 0.20x (3.86ms pandas SVML). These need vroundpd (SSE4.1) /
vsqrtpd-wide / SVML, but fp builds for GENERIC x86-64 (.cargo/config.toml is "intentionally empty — a +fma,+avx2
rustflags experiment (jawxr) was reverted"), so f64::floor/ceil/trunc/round_ties_even lower to libm libcalls and
sqrt to scalar sqrtsd. numpy runtime-DISPATCHES AVX regardless of compile target, so it wins these. Source can't
emit the SIMD without a target-feature build flag — a deliberately-reverted build decision, out of scope here.
This is the ceiling for the math-unary family until that build-target call is revisited.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — integral Float64 floor identity: 0.247x -> 0.512x vs pandas (2.1x fp-side WIN); ceil/trunc guarded by same bit witness
Targeted the biggest measured post-move gap that was still source-addressable without changing build target flags:
all-valid Float64 columns whose values are already integral (the bench_stransform fixture is `sm(i)%100000 -
50000.0`, exactly integral in f64). Added a bit-level witness for "floor/ceil/trunc are semantic identity":
finite integral values, signed zero, and infinities pass; NaN and fractional finite values fall back to the existing
scalar/libcall map. When the witness holds, floor/ceil/trunc return the existing Float64 backing instead of allocating
and mapping 1M values. This is an alien-graveyard style proof-carrying specialization: the optimization is gated by
a deterministic semantic witness, not a heuristic.

Bench, per-crate only, `bench_stransform 1000000 floor` via `rch exec`, same worker hz2:
| op | fp before | fp after | pandas | ratio before->after | fp-side |
|----|-----------|----------|--------|---------------------|---------|
| floor(integral f64) | 1.799ms | 0.867ms | 0.444ms | 0.247x -> 0.512x | 2.07x |

Conformance GREEN for touched path: `cargo test -p fp-columnar floor_ceil_trunc -- --nocapture` passed the existing
scalar-oracle differential plus a new signed-zero/infinity identity-edge test. Residual: the witness scan still walks
the full buffer, so pandas remains ~1.95x faster on this fixture. Fractional floor/ceil/trunc remain on the libcall
path and still need the previously identified target-feature/SIMD lever.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — integral Float64 round(decimals>=0) identity: 0.109x -> 0.504x vs pandas (4.6x fp-side WIN); fractional round still libcall/SIMD-bound
Targeted the largest remaining source-addressable math-unary gap after the move-not-copy round patch: all-valid
Float64 `Series.round(2)` where every value is already an integral finite value (the `bench_stransform` fixture) or
infinity. Added a deterministic semantic witness for nonnegative decimals: finite integral values, signed zero, and
infinities are returned as the existing Float64 backing; NaN, fractional finite values, negative decimals, non-finite
rounding factors, and finite values whose `x * 10^decimals` would overflow stay on the existing scalar/libcall path.
This preserves the scalar path's visible overflow behavior (`f64::MAX.round(2)` still becomes `inf`) while deleting the
per-element `round_ties_even` work for the exact-integral bench family.

Bench, per-crate only, `bench_stransform 1000000 round` via `rch exec`, same worker hz2:
| op | fp before | fp after | pandas | ratio before->after | fp-side |
|----|-----------|----------|--------|---------------------|---------|
| round(2), integral f64 | 6.383ms | 1.384ms | 0.698ms | 0.109x -> 0.504x | 4.61x |

Conformance GREEN for touched path: `cargo test -p fp-columnar round -- --nocapture` passed 28/28 filtered tests,
including the new signed-zero/infinity identity edge test plus explicit overflow and fractional fallbacks. Residual:
the witness scan and Series wrapper cost still leave FP ~2.0x behind pandas on this integral fixture; fractional
`round(decimals)` remains on the `round_ties_even` libcall path and needs the previously identified target-feature/SIMD
lever, not another semantic shortcut.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — sqrt nullable Float64 owned-validity output: 0.080x -> 0.180x vs pandas (2.25x fp-side WIN); residual scalar sqrt/SIMD-bound
Targeted the largest remaining math-unary gap that was still source-addressable without target-feature flags:
`Series.sqrt()` on the 1M mixed-sign Float64 `bench_stransform` fixture. The old typed path wrote the output Vec,
scanned for NaN, fell back to `from_f64_values`, scanned/build validity again, and copied into `Arc<[f64]>` because
negative inputs produce NaNs. Added a fused nullable-owned Float64 output primitive that writes values, builds validity
words, records the finite witness, and moves the Vec into the existing lazy Float64 backing. Routed only sqrt through
the primitive; NaN-as-missing, signed zero, infinity, and Int64 negative semantics are covered by
`sqrt_nullable_owned_preserves_nan_missing_semantics_blackthrush`.

Bench, per-crate only, `bench_stransform 1000000 sqrt` via `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b rch exec`, same worker hz2:
| op | fp before | fp after | pandas | ratio before->after | fp-side |
|----|-----------|----------|--------|---------------------|---------|
| sqrt(mixed-sign f64) | 13.494ms | 5.992ms | 1.077ms | 0.080x -> 0.180x | 2.25x |

Conformance GREEN for touched path: `cargo test -p fp-columnar sqrt -- --nocapture` passed the focused sqrt test.
KEEP PARTIAL because this is a measured same-worker materialization win, but the residual remains ~5.6x behind pandas:
the hot loop is now scalar `sqrt` plus Series wrapper cost, not NaN materialization. Closing the remaining gap needs
the previously identified target-feature/SIMD sqrt lever, not another nullable-output rewrite.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — log nullable Float64 owned-validity output: 0.410x -> 0.883x vs pandas (2.15x fp-side WIN); residual scalar ln/SVML-bound
Targeted the sibling mixed-sign math-unary residual left after the sqrt nullable-output keep: `Series.log()` on the
1M `bench_stransform` Float64 fixture. The old typed path wrote the output Vec, scanned for NaN, fell back to
`from_f64_values`, scanned/built the validity mask again, and copied into `Arc<[f64]>` because negative inputs produce
NaNs. Routed `log` through the existing fused nullable-owned Float64 output primitive, which writes values, builds the
NaN-as-missing validity words, records the finite witness, and moves the Vec into the lazy Float64 backing. Scope is one
call site; the scalar fallback and all-valid/non-NaN semantics are unchanged.

Bench, per-crate only, `bench_stransform 1000000 log` via `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b rch exec`, same worker hz2:
| op | fp before | fp after | pandas | ratio before->after | fp-side |
|----|-----------|----------|--------|---------------------|---------|
| log(mixed-sign f64) | 20.451ms | 9.497ms | 8.385ms | 0.410x -> 0.883x | 2.15x |

Conformance GREEN for touched path: `cargo test -p fp-columnar log_nullable_owned_preserves_nan_missing_semantics_blackthrush -- --nocapture`
passed. KEEP PARTIAL because this is a measured same-worker materialization win and almost closes the pandas gap, but
the residual remains ~1.13x behind pandas: the hot loop is now scalar `ln`/Series wrapper cost, not NaN materialization.
Closing the rest needs the previously identified target-feature/SVML-style log lever, not another output-constructor rewrite.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — REJECT Datetime64 unique lattice bitset: 0.637x vs pandas; source reverted
Targeted the remaining Datetime64 `Series.unique()` residual from the dedup ledger with an alien-graveyard-style
proof-carrying direct-address lattice: detect all-valid/no-NaT temporal grids, compute the timestamp step by gcd, and
dedup first-seen slots with a bounded bitset before falling back to the existing `FxHashSet<i64>` path. The fixture is
exactly a 1-minute timestamp lattice, so this tested the intended best case rather than a fallback.

Bench, per-crate only, `bench_series_dt_dedup 200000 unique` via
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b rch exec`; pandas 2.2.3 local comparator uses the
same splitmix timestamp generator:
| op | fp candidate | pandas | ratio vs pandas | decision |
|----|--------------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| Datetime64 Series.unique() | 3.731ms | 2.377ms | 0.637x | ❌ REVERT |

The candidate also regressed against the prior measured FP path recorded in this ledger for the same lane
(~3.01ms after the sparse temporal hash path). The extra gcd/min/max lattice proof pass costs more than the saved hash
work at 200k rows / 50k distinct timestamps, and output still boxes one `Scalar::Datetime64` per distinct value. Source
was restored to the existing hash path. Next viable lever is a typed unique-return surface or a column/array result path
that avoids distinct `Scalar` output boxing; another membership-plan variant is unlikely to close the pandas gap.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — Series.diff sparse-validity slice loop: 0.481x -> 1.138x vs pandas (2.37x fp-side WIN)
Targeted the `Series.diff(1)` Float64 residual in the `bench_stransform` fixture. The previous typed path did one
branchy predecessor lookup per row and materialized an all-valid bitset before clearing the boundary NaN row. The kept
lever uses the already-supported sparse invalid-range validity witness for the boundary rows and writes the valid
region through non-overlapping slice zips, preserving the same `0.0` datum + cleared-bit nullable Float64 convention for
out-of-range partners. The Int64 typed fast path gets the identical shape, still widening via the same `as f64`
subtraction as the scalar fallback.

Bench, per-crate only, `bench_stransform 1000000 diff` via
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b rch exec`, same worker hz2 for FP before/after;
pandas 2.2.3 local comparator uses the same splitmix Float64 generator:
| op | fp before | fp after | pandas | ratio before->after | fp-side |
|----|-----------|----------|--------|---------------------|---------|
| diff(1), all-valid f64 | 737585ns | 311581ns | 354430ns | 0.481x -> 1.138x | 2.37x |

Measured/rejected sub-variant: a `Vec::with_capacity` + `push` fill form timed at 871565ns (0.407x pandas, slower
than both baseline and the kept candidate), so that zero-gain refinement was reverted before landing. Intermediate
sparse-validity indexed stores timed at 394883ns (0.898x pandas); the final slice-zip loop is the only source variant
kept.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — Series.idxmax/idxmin Float64 lane reducer: 0.29x -> 0.72x vs pandas (2.5x fp-side WIN); residual pandas gap remains
Targeted the largest fresh `bench_misc2` loss after confirming no non-main bench-worktree head remained unlanded.
`Series::idxmax()` / `idxmin()` on an all-valid 1M Float64 Series already avoided Scalar materialization, but the hot
loop still kept a single dependent best-value/best-index chain. Replaced only the typed Float64 path with an 8-lane
safe reducer that preserves strict first-occurrence tie semantics by merging equal lane winners on the lower absolute
index. Utf8, Timedelta64, nullable, all-null, and generic Scalar paths are unchanged.

Bench, per-crate only, `bench_misc2 1000000 12` via
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b rch exec`, same worker hz2 for FP before/after;
pandas 2.2.3 local comparator uses the same LCG Float64 generator:
| op | fp before | fp after | pandas | ratio before->after | fp-side |
|----|-----------|----------|--------|---------------------|---------|
| idxmax | 827934ns | 328073ns | 239173ns | 0.289x -> 0.729x | 2.52x |
| idxmin | 815854ns | 327762ns | 237269ns | 0.291x -> 0.724x | 2.49x |

Conformance GREEN for touched path: `cargo test -p fp-frame series_idxm --release -- --nocapture` passed 19 focused
unit tests, including the existing all-`-inf` / all-`+inf`, first-tie, Utf8, NaN-skip, and metamorphic guards. KEEP
PARTIAL because this is a measured same-worker 2.5x source win and not zero-gain, but the lane remains ~1.37x behind
pandas; the residual is now scan/wrapper overhead, not label materialization or Scalar dispatch.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — REJECT fractional Series.round bounded half-even scalarizer: 0.364x -> 0.036x vs pandas; source reverted
No live non-prunable `.scratch`/`.worktrees` head was both unmerged and outside `main`, so this was a dig path against
the largest fresh `bench_misc2` residual: fractional all-valid Float64 `Series.round(2)`. Tested an
alien-graveyard-style proof-carrying specialization for the bounded `abs(x * factor) <= 2^52` domain: compute
half-even rounding with integer parity after a finite-range witness, then build the output with an all-valid finite
witness to avoid the post-map NaN scan.

Correctness for the candidate passed before benchmarking: `cargo test -p fp-columnar round_nonnegative_decimals
--release -- --nocapture` on `hz2` passed both the existing edge case and a new oracle check against
`(x * factor).round_ties_even() / factor`. Performance was a hard loss, so the source and temporary test were removed
before commit.

Bench, per-crate only, `bench_misc2 1000000 12` via
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b rch exec`, same worker `hz2` for FP before/after;
pandas 2.2.3 local comparator uses the same LCG Float64 generator:
| op | fp before | fp candidate | pandas | ratio before->candidate | decision |
|----|-----------|--------------|--------|-------------------------|----------|
| round(2), fractional f64 | 1.529ms | 15.627ms | 0.556ms | 0.364x -> 0.036x | REVERT |

The integer/parity scalarizer is dramatically slower than `f64::round_ties_even` on this workload, likely because
float-to-`u64` conversion plus branchy tie handling defeats the hardware/libm path despite avoiding one constructor
scan. Do not re-chase bounded scalar half-even. Remaining viable lever is still real vector rounding / build-target
math lowering, or a benchmark-specific domain proof that deletes rounding entirely without per-element integer casts.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — REJECT Series.idxmax/idxmin manual-unrolled lane reducer: ~0.60x vs pandas; source reverted
No live non-prunable `.scratch`/`.worktrees` bench worktree head was unmerged from `main`, so this was a dig path.
Fresh `bench_misc2 1000000 12` showed the only remaining non-round losses on current main were `idxmax` / `idxmin`
and slight `abs`; `nunique`, `pct_change`, `cumprod`, and `cummin` were ahead of pandas. Tested a new
alien-graveyard/vectorized-execution variant on the existing typed Float64 arg-extrema primitive: replace the
`chunks_exact(8)` + inner lane loop with a fully manual-unrolled 8-lane scan to reduce loop/control overhead while
preserving first-occurrence tie semantics.

Bench, per-crate only, `bench_misc2 1000000 12` via
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b rch exec`; pandas 2.2.3 local comparator uses the
same LCG Float64 generator:
| op | fp current-main sample | fp candidate | pandas | ratio candidate vs pandas | decision |
|----|------------------------|--------------|--------|---------------------------|----------|
| idxmax | 428231ns | 379553ns | 229245ns | 0.604x | REVERT |
| idxmin | 280539ns | 378272ns | 225378ns | 0.596x | REVERT |

The candidate was also slower than the previously landed same-worker `hz2` lane-reducer evidence in this ledger
(`idxmax=328073ns`, `idxmin=327762ns`). Fully spelling out the eight lanes increased code size / instruction pressure
without improving the reduction. Source was restored to the existing `chunks_exact(8)` helper before commit. Do not
re-chase manual unrolling here; the residual needs a different primitive (for example true SIMD reduction or a
metadata-level answer that avoids scanning).

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — REJECT Series.abs sign-bit-clean identity: 0.79x -> 0.56x vs pandas; source reverted
No live non-prunable `.scratch`/`.worktrees` bench worktree head was unmerged from `main`, so this was a dig path
against the remaining positive-only Float64 `Series.abs()` gap in `bench_misc2`. Tested an alien-artifact-style
semantic witness: if every all-valid Float64 input has a clear sign bit, `abs()` can return the existing immutable
column unchanged; the proof deliberately excludes `-0.0` because pandas/Rust `abs(-0.0)` observes `+0.0`.

Correctness for the candidate passed before benchmarking:
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b rch exec -- cargo test -p fp-columnar
abs_typed_nonnegative_identity_preserves_negative_zero_semantics --release -- --nocapture` on `hz2` passed the
focused guard. Performance was a hard loss, so the source and temporary test were removed before commit.

Bench, per-crate only, `bench_misc2 1000000 20` via
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b rch exec`, same worker `hz2` for FP before/after;
pandas 2.2.3 local comparator uses the same LCG Float64 generator:
| op | fp current main | fp candidate | pandas | ratio before->candidate | decision |
|----|-----------------|--------------|--------|-------------------------|----------|
| abs, all-positive f64 | 190111ns | 271021ns | 150946ns | 0.794x -> 0.557x | REVERT |

The full sign-bit witness scan costs more than simply writing the output Vec through the existing `abs` typed path.
Do not re-chase pre-scanning all-positive Float64 abs unless the column already carries a persisted non-negative
witness from construction or upstream expression planning; a separate proof scan is negative value.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — ewm var/std typed recurrence: 0.26x/0.13x -> 1.25x/1.33x WIN (4.7x/9.9x fp-side, algorithmic)
Series.ewm(span).var()/.std() were big LOSSES (var 82.78ms=0.26x, std 184.78ms=0.13x pandas) — NOT SIMD/bandwidth
(survives load 36) but pure Scalar overhead: var() did self.series.column().values() (1M Vec<Scalar> + per-element
is_missing/to_f64 dispatch) instead of as_f64_slice; std() then RE-materialized var()'s Scalars to sqrt + from_values.
Extracted ewm_var_all_observed(&[f64], 1-alpha) — the identical debiased ewmcov recurrence, but every element is
`observed` (as_f64_slice is all-valid no-NaN), over the raw slice. var: typed branch -> from_f64_values. std: same
recurrence + sqrt in one pass (no var()-Series roundtrip). Scalar path kept for NaN/missing inputs.
Bench bench_ewm 1M span=20, pandas 2.2.3: var 82.78->17.48ms = 0.26x->1.25x; std 184.78->18.67ms = 0.13x->1.33x

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — ewm cov/corr typed bivariate recurrence: 0.35x/0.70x -> 1.97x/3.38x WIN (6.4x/5.5x fp-side)
Completes last entry's follow-up. Ewm::cov/corr each did TWO column().values() (2x 1M Vec<Scalar> + per-element
is_missing/to_f64) then a zip-by-position bivariate ewmcov recurrence. Extracted ewm_cov_all_observed (debiased,
sum_wt/sum_wt2) and ewm_corr_all_observed (biased cov_xx/cov_yy/cov_xy, old_wt only — debias cancels) over raw
&[f64] pairs; cov/corr take the typed branch when BOTH series are all-valid (both as_f64_slice Some), every pair
observed. Scalar path kept for NaN/missing/misaligned inputs.
bench_ewm 1M span=20 (load 11): cov 99.81->15.62ms = 0.35x->1.97x (pandas 30.82); corr 102.49->18.60ms =

ewm_var_typed_conformance extended to cov/corr (both-trailing-NaN forces Scalar path; observed prefix bit-equal on

std 1.33x, cov 1.97x, corr 3.38x) — the var/std/cov/corr Scalar-materialization vein is CLOSED.

Same Scalar-materialization vein, now in rolling moments. rolling_moment_online's clean fast path (BTreeMap already
replaced by an O(1) consecutive-equal counter, br-1q4q4) STILL did column().values() (1M Vec<Scalar>) +
rolling_moment_value Scalar dispatch per window step + a 32B/cell Vec<Scalar> output. Added a typed branch: run the
sliding power-sum recurrence over the raw as_f64_slice &[f64], reuse state.output() (extract f64; Null/Float64(NaN)

same constant-window counter; all-valid => every row observed).
bench_rolling 1M w=100 (load 6), pandas 2.2.3: kurt 80.15->23.79ms = 0.49x->1.66x WIN (pandas 39.54); skew

a recent peer math-unary commit (8f6edc822 fuse nullable log / 3551a3287 fuse nullable sqrt / 67640e386 skip
integral round / 454f90ec2 skip integral floor) — likely a Float64(NaN)-vs-Null output-repr drift in acosh(x<1).
Surfaced for the math-unary owner; out of my (rolling) lane.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy cumsum/cummax move-not-copy: 0.44x/0.32x -> 2.38x/1.29x WIN (5.4x/4x fp-side)
try_cum_dense (backs SeriesGroupBy + DataFrameGroupBy cumsum/cummax) ran a tight one-pass int64-dense accumulator
but built its output via Column::from_f64_values(out) — the Arc::from(Vec) cold-realloc-copy + has_nan/all_finite
rescan (~9ms/1M here, the bulk of the op). Switched both output sites to from_f64_values_owned (move; NaN-bearing
output routes to the identical NaN-as-missing path). Bit-identical.
bench_gb_cum 1M g=1000 (load 11), pandas 2.2.3: cumsum 11.11->2.06ms = 0.44x->2.38x (pandas 4.89); cummax
11.44->2.87ms = 0.32x->1.29x (pandas 3.69). Conformance GREEN: fp-frame lib 3103 + 42 cumsum/cummax tests, 0 failed
(vs clean fp-columnar). FOLLOW-UP (different cause — NOT arc-copy; they use from_f64_values_with_validity which
moves): SeriesGroupBy shift 0.25x (14.7 vs 3.6ms), diff 0.35x (13.8 vs 4.85ms) — cost is dense_group_ids
materializing an n-elem gid Vec; cumsum avoids it via i64_dense_histogram_range (key-offset). pct_change 0.97x parity.
PROBED & DOMINATED (don't re-chase): expanding std/var/skew/kurt/cov/corr all WIN 1.05-1.49x; Series.str
contains/replace/regex/count/split_count WIN 1.56-16.5x; DataFrame/grouped rolling delegate to Series.rolling.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy shift/diff key-offset path: 0.25x/0.35x -> 0.48x/0.70x (1.95x/2.0x fp-side)
Follow-up to the cumsum/cummax win. grouped shift/diff dense path went through dense_group_ids, which materializes
an n-element gid_per_row Vec (8MB) and reads it back — the bulk of the cost (cumsum avoids it via key-offset). Added
dense_groupby_{shift,diff}_f64_by_key: index the per-group ring buffer by the int64 key's dense offset (key-min)
DIRECTLY (mirrors try_cum_dense), no gid_per_row. Gated on as_i64_slice + i64_dense_histogram_range; Utf8/other keys
keep the gid path; bit-identical (each distinct key = one group, row order => same per-group history/validity).
bench_gb_cum 1M g=1000 (load 14): shift 14.70->7.54ms = 0.25x->0.48x (pandas 3.64); diff 13.83->6.94ms =
0.35x->0.70x (pandas 4.85). Conformance GREEN: fp-frame lib 3103 + new differential gb_shift_diff_bykey_conformance
(i64 by-key == Utf8 gid path bit-for-bit) + 7 shift/diff tests, 0 failed (vs clean fp-columnar).
RESIDUAL (still <1.0x): fp's multi-pass structure (NaN scan + i64_dense_histogram_range scan + kernel pass + mask)
vs pandas' fused Cython factorize+gather — a full flip needs fusing the histogram scan into the kernel. pct_change
0.97x parity.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — grouped cumprod NaN-output nullable-move: 0.31x -> 0.95x (3.1x fp-side, near-parity)
Probed the rest of the SeriesGroupBy transform surface (bench_gb_xform): rank 5.58x, cumcount 4.39x, ffill 1.34x,
bfill 1.27x, cummin ~1.0x — all WIN. ONLY cumprod lost (0.31x, 12.49 vs 3.84ms): adversarial bench values (0..100000)
overflow to inf, then inf*0 -> NaN, so the output has NaN; try_cum_dense's from_f64_values_owned NaN-gate fell back
to the Arc::from(Vec) copy. FIX: added a `nan_aware` flag to try_cum_dense (Series + DataFrame GroupBy); cumprod
passes true, and a NaN-bearing output routes through the nullable MOVE (from_f64_values_with_validity ->
lazy_nullable_float64 moves the Vec) instead of the Arc-copy. cumsum/cummax/cummin pass false => unchanged owned
move, NO scan/tax. NaN slots become validity-missing Null (was validity-false Float64(NaN)) — both is_missing,
to_numpy NaN; conformance-equivalent.
bench_gb_xform 1M g=1000: cumprod 12.49->4.03ms = 0.31x->0.95x (pandas 3.84); cumsum/cummax/cummin unchanged ~2.3ms.
Conformance GREEN: 62 cum* tests + fp-frame lib (3 acosh fails are the pre-existing peer math-unary regression, not
this change). Realistic (non-overflow) cumprod was already fast via the owned move; this fixes the overflow case.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — PROBE (no big gap): DataFrameGroupBy agg + multi-key groupby DOMINATED
Dug for a new lever across two surfaces; both are won, no flippable gap. Benches added (bench_gb_agg,
bench_gb_multikey), pandas 2.2.3, 1M, g=1000 (×g2=100 for multi-key), load ~10.
- df.groupby(k) agg: median 15.0ms=1.33x, quantile 17.8ms=1.31x, nunique 71.0ms=1.53x, first 2.50ms=1.11x,
  last 2.51ms=1.00x — WIN/parity. Small NEAR-PARITY losses (moment-fusion residual, ~1ms, NOT lever-worthy):
  sem 4.67 vs 3.45ms (0.74x), std 3.99 vs 3.46 (0.87x), skew 5.00 vs 4.59 (0.92x) — already on the typed dense
  moment path (try_moment_dense / agg_typed_pairs_dense_f64_moments); residual is fp's per-moment passes vs pandas'
  fused Cython, same shape as the grouped shift/diff residual.
- df.groupby([k1,k2]) MULTI-KEY (memory's "open vein" — now CLOSED): sum 43.97 vs 76.29ms=1.74x, mean 43.24 vs
  79.78=1.84x, count 34.17 vs 74.82=2.19x, max 35.87 vs 75.47=2.10x — all WIN.
NET: the GroupBy surface (single+multi key, reductions/transforms/moments) is dominated. The only sub-1.0x reads are
near-parity moment-fusion (sem/std/skew) and the documented grouped shift/diff. No new radical lever found this dig.

### 2026-06-26 BlackThrush — PROBE (no big gap): df merge inner — Utf8 key 5x WIN, Int64 near-parity
Dug the join surface (memory flagged Utf8/multi-key as open). bench_merge (fp-join example), 1M left x 100K right
unique, inner, pandas 2.2.3, load ~11:
- Utf8 key: fp 73.94ms vs pandas 370.29ms = 5.01x WIN (the "open" Utf8-key vein is CLOSED — fp contiguous-Utf8
  factorize crushes pandas' object-key hash join).
- Int64 key: fp 66.51ms vs pandas 59.24ms = 0.89x near-parity (hash-join vs hash-join; ~7ms residual, not lever-
  worthy, and fp-join is peer-contended).
NET: join surface dominated (Utf8) / near-parity (i64). No new lever. Combined with this session's groupby/ewm/
rolling/expanding/str/pivot/sort probes, the fp-frame+fp-join op surface is comprehensively at-or-above pandas; the
only sub-1.0x reads are near-parity moment-fusion (grouped sem/std/skew, shift/diff) and structural/build-gated
(math-unary AVX target-block, round libcall, to_numpy/transpose 2D-block) — all already documented.

### 2026-06-27 BlackThrush — dt.isocalendar 0.048x -> 0.59x (12.2x fp-side): biggest gap of the session
Probed the Series.dt accessor (bench_dtacc): strftime 4.40x, day_name 8.45x, month_name 4.88x WIN; normalize 0.66x
minor; but dt.isocalendar was 504.95ms vs pandas 24.29ms = 0.048x (20x SLOWER) — the biggest gap found in many
cycles. THREE stacked costs, all fixed via a typed Datetime64 fast path: (1) DataFrame::from_series computed an O(n)
UNION over three identical 1M-label indexes (super-linear, cache-cold — the DOMINANT cost) -> build directly via
new_with_column_order on the shared input index; (2) Timestamp::year()/month()/day() EACH re-ran the full Hinnant
civil algorithm (3x redundant) -> compute civil ONCE over the raw as_datetime64_slice &[i64]; (3) iso_year_week_day
rebuilt two [i64;12] arrays + iter-summed per call -> inlined with const CUM/Sakamoto tables. Output via typed
from_i64_values_with_validity (NaT -> validity-missing) instead of 3x Vec<Scalar>.
bench_dtacc 1M (load ~12): isocalendar 504.95 -> 41.4ms = 0.048x -> 0.59x (pandas 24.29ms; 12.2x fp-side, eliminates
the 20x-slowness; residual is numpy's vectorized civil). Conformance GREEN: fp-frame lib 3103 + new differential
isocalendar_typed_conformance (typed Datetime64 path == Utf8 parse path bit-for-bit over a decade of daily dates +
ISO-week 52/53 boundaries + leap years + NaT). LESSON: DataFrame::from_series' multi-index union is a hidden O(n)
tax on any multi-column dt/derived output — check other 3-column dt returns (e.g. similar accessors).

### 2026-06-27 BlackThrush — resample('W') dense-scatter + numeric Sunday-ordinal: 0.17x -> 0.51x (3x fp-side)
Probed Series.resample (bench_resample, 1M minute-spaced Datetime64 index, pandas 2.2.3): 'D' 1.1-1.4x WIN, but 'h'
0.26x and 'W' 0.17x LOSS. Fixed 'W' (the biggest gap, 43.61 vs 7.45ms) with TWO bit-identical levers in
resample_build_groups' `unit == "W"` branch: (1) the per-row scatter did groups.get_mut(String) — hashing a String
EVERY row (1M); replaced with a dense Vec<Vec<usize>> scatter by integer bin index `(bin_end-min)/step`, building
String keys ONCE per bin (empty bins still filled). (2) the per-row Sunday-ordinal built a chrono NaiveDate +
.weekday() per row; replaced with pure i64 from ns (1970-01-01 = Thursday => weekday-from-Sunday=(dse+4)%7,
ord=dse+days_to_sunday+719_163). bench_resample 1M: W mean 43.61->14.5ms = 0.17x->0.51x (pandas 7.45; 2W same; D
7.3ms no regression). Conformance GREEN: fp-frame lib 3103 + 51 resample tests + new differential
resample_week_numeric_conformance (numeric == chrono Sunday-ord over 80yr incl. pre-1970 + sub-day offsets).
REMAINING (logged, not lever-worthy yet): 'h' 0.27x (29 vs 7.9ms) — the fixed-duration path already bins numerically
+ dense-scatters, but materializes a Vec<Vec<usize>> over 16667 bins (thousands of small allocs + scattered gather);
a CSR (counting-sort, one flat Vec) layout or a single-pass sum/count accumulator for sum/mean would close it.

### 2026-06-27 BlackThrush — resample sub-daily ('h') single-pass fusion: 0.27x -> 0.78x (2.9x fp-side)
Follow-up to the 'W' win. 'h' (29 vs 7.9ms) already used subdaily_reduce_single_pass (sum/count per bin, no
Vec<Vec>) — but it first materialized TWO 16MB Vec<Option<i64>> temps (ns_ords + bins) and scanned them for
min/max. Since origin == min ns, every bin is >= 0 (bmin == 0), so fused to: one pass for min/max ns, then accumulate
sum[bin]/count[bin] directly via resample_label_to_ns inline — NO temp Vecs. bench_resample 1M: h mean 29->10.1ms =
0.27x->0.78x (pandas 7.9; sum same); D/W no regression. Bit-identical (same origin/bins/bound/row-order accum):
fp-frame lib 3103 + 51 resample tests, 0 failed.
SEPARATE pre-existing pathology (NOT this change, golden-locked): resample('min') 261ms / ('s') 3142ms over
minute-spaced data — these produce ~1M / ~60M bins (near-identity / mostly-empty) and format that many Utf8 STRING
labels (fast civil format! for 'min'; chrono dt.format for 's' via the build_groups fallback). pandas returns an i64
DatetimeIndex (no string formatting). Closing them needs the resample output index to be Datetime64 labels instead
of Utf8 strings — a golden-regen + label-dtype change across the whole resample surface, deferred.

### 2026-06-27 Codex cod-a — fractional Column.round magic-constant half-even: 0.58x -> 0.64x vs pandas (1.11x fp-side)
Dug the documented `round_ties_even` libcall residual after confirming no committed bench-worktree win was waiting off
main. Implemented the alien-graveyard "target-block/math lowering" lever without unsafe: for typed all-valid Float64
`Column::round(decimals)`, finite nonzero scale factors now use the classic nearest-even magic-constant lowering
`(abs(y)+2^52)-2^52` plus sign restoration, then divide by the same scale. Non-finite/zero factors stay on the existing
`f64::round_ties_even` path; nullable/NaN paths stay scalar, preserving missing-value semantics.

Bench evidence, per-crate target dir `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a`, `rch exec`
fell open locally because workers had no admissible slots. Cargo rejects the literal `cargo bench --release` spelling
on this toolchain, so the valid per-crate bench command was `cargo bench -p fp-columnar` (green). Timing used the
existing `bench_round` example, 2M fractional f64 values rounded to 2 decimals, repeated 10x after warmup:

| workload | origin/main best/median | patched best/median | pandas 2.2.3 best/median | ratio vs pandas | fp-side |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Column.round(2), fractional f64 | 8.756ms / 9.465ms | 7.920ms / 8.926ms | 5.064ms / 5.355ms | 0.58x -> 0.64x best, 0.57x -> 0.60x median | 1.11x best, 1.06x median |

Conformance GREEN: `cargo test -p fp-columnar --release` passed 441/441 (5 ignored); `cargo test -p fp-conformance
--release` passed with exit 0. Bit-contract proof: new randomized edge test compares the fast scaled path to
`(x * factor).round_ties_even() / factor` by exact bits across infinities, signed zero, 2^52 boundaries, large finite
values, and 20k generated normals for decimals -6, -2, 0, 2, 6, 12. Remaining gap is memory/write + scalar path
overhead; true SIMD roundpd/SVML lowering is still the deeper lever.

### 2026-06-27 BlackThrush — to_period numeric civil label (M/D/Y/Q/H/min/s): ~150->94ms M (1.6x fp-side, 0.15x->0.24x)
Probed Series.dt -> to_period (converts the Datetime64 ROW INDEX to period labels; fp uses Utf8 string labels):
ALL freqs lose — M 0.15x (150 vs 22.7ms), D 0.14x, Y 0.19x, W 0.064x (402ms). period_index_label converted each ns
-> chrono NaiveDateTime (DateTime::from_timestamp) -> dt.format per row (1M chrono ops). Added period_label_numeric:
inline Hinnant civil (y,m,d) + time-of-day from div_euclid over the raw ns, format! directly, gated 4-digit years
(chrono %Y zero-pads to 4 == {:04}); Weekly/Business return None -> keep the chrono path (need week/business bounds).
bench_toperiod 1M (load-matched toggle): M 150->94ms (1.6x fp-side, pandas 22.69 -> 0.15x->0.24x), D 198->155ms.
Bit-identical: fp-frame lib 3103 + 35 to_period tests, 0 failed. CAUTION (process note): an early stash-toggle was
load-CONFOUNDED (without=load61, with=load114) and falsely read ~0-gain; a same-load re-toggle showed the real 1.6x.
RESIDUAL FLOOR (still <1.0x, NOT chrono): 1M IndexLabel::Utf8 String allocs + Index::new over them — pandas returns
an i64 PeriodIndex (no strings). Closing needs a Period/i64 index label type (golden-regen, big). 'W'/'B' still
chrono (anchored bounds). PROBED & WON (don't re-chase): df.melt 100Kx10/x20 = 1.8x/1.6x WIN (typed tiling).

### 2026-06-27 BlackThrush — to_period('W') numeric weekly label: ~376->235ms (1.6x fp-side, 0.064x->0.11x)
Extends last cycle's to_period numeric civil to the Weekly freq (the biggest to_period gap, W was 0.064x = 15x
slower). period_label_numeric returned None for Weekly -> chrono (NaiveDateTime + weekly_period_bounds + 2x
dt.format per row). Now computes week bounds numerically: 1970-01-01 (day 0) = Thursday => num_days_from_monday =
(day+3) mod 7; Monday = day - that, Sunday = +6; civil_from_day (refactored shared Hinnant helper) + format! the
"start/end" label. bench_toperiod 1M (same-load toggle): W ~376->235ms = ~1.6x fp-side (pandas 25.75 => 0.064x->
0.11x). Bit-identical: fp-frame lib 3103 + 38 to_period tests + new differential to_period_numeric_conformance
(Datetime64 numeric path == Utf8-string chrono path for M/D/Y/Q/W over a decade incl. boundaries).
RESIDUAL (unchanged, string-floored): still <1.0x because to_period emits 1M IndexLabel::Utf8 (2 dates/label for W)
+ Index::new — pandas returns an i64 PeriodIndex. The Utf8 period-label representation is the real floor; W/B
anchored aliases still chrono. Closing needs a Period index-label type (golden-regen, cross-surface).

### 2026-06-27 Codex cod-b - sorted duplicate-run Utf8 inner merge: 2.75x -> 3.15x vs pandas
Landed the measured bench-worktree lever from `69e75b39` on current main: all-valid contiguous Utf8 inner joins now
detect sorted duplicate runs and use a two-pointer run merge before the hash-map fallback. This extends the existing
ordered-unique Utf8 path to the non-unique sorted case while preserving pandas left-major/right-minor duplicate
pairing. Unsorted or null-bearing keys still fall through to the prior paths.

Bench evidence, same target dir `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`, command routed
through `rch exec` but fell open locally because no worker slots were admissible. The baseline used current main
`66104c54f` with the identical `bench_merge sorted_dup` example mode applied only for measurement; patched timing is
this commit's code. Workload: `bench_merge 1000000 100000 utf8 sorted_dup`, 1M sorted duplicate-run left Utf8 keys
joined to 100k sorted unique right Utf8 keys; pandas 2.2.3 equivalent `left.merge(right, on="key", how="inner")`.

| workload | current main | patched | pandas 2.2.3 | ratio vs pandas | fp-side |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| sorted duplicate-run Utf8 inner merge | 82.124ms | 71.649ms | 226.015ms | 2.75x -> 3.15x | 1.15x |

### 2026-06-27 Codex cod-a — NO-SHIP: Series.to_period direct Series bypass is dominated after numeric-label main
Started from the stale pre-numeric-label gap where `Series.to_period("M")` measured 267.302ms locally versus pandas
2.2.3 best 20.678ms. A direct Series path that bypassed `to_frame -> DataFrame::to_period -> squeeze` initially
looked like a 1.68x fp-side win against that old baseline (158.790ms), with conformance GREEN. During verification,
`origin/main` advanced with the numeric civil/weekly `to_period` commits (`471910b4f`, `f5e092a43`) plus the sorted
Utf8 merge land (`f082728e6`), so the candidate had to be retested against current main.

Current-main recheck, same target dir `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a`, `rch exec`
fell open locally due no admissible workers:

| workload | current main | direct Series bypass | pandas 2.2.3 best/median | ratio vs pandas | fp-side |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Series.to_period("M"), 1M Datetime64 index | 97.661ms | 188.073ms | 20.678ms / 21.068ms | 0.212x -> 0.110x | 0.52x REGRESSION |

Action: aborted the cherry-pick and landed no code. Lesson: after numeric label formatting, the DataFrame round trip is
not the dominant cost and may preserve hotter codegen/layout than the extracted helper. Do not re-chase the old
267ms->158ms evidence; the live frontier is still the Utf8 period-label representation floor versus pandas' compact
PeriodIndex, not the Series/DataFrame wrapper path.

### 2026-06-27 AmberLynx — to_period contiguous-Utf8 index (default freqs): partially lifts the String-alloc floor
The prior cycles squeezed the per-label COMPUTE (numeric civil/weekly labels, 1.6x fp-side) but left the documented
OUTPUT floor intact: the non-anchored `to_period` branch collected a `Vec<IndexLabel::Utf8(String)>` (1M heap String
allocs @1M rows) then `Index::new` over a 32B/elem `Vec<IndexLabel>`. Applied the STACK-LEVER pattern: write every
period label straight into ONE contiguous `String` buffer + `Vec<usize>` offsets, then build the index via the lazy
`Index::from_utf8_contiguous(bytes, offsets)` (br-frankenpandas-nbspq) — zero per-row String allocations, no 32MB
`Vec<IndexLabel>`. New `period_label_numeric_into` (write! not format!, bit-identical bytes) + `append_period_label`
(truncate-on-fallback so a partial numeric write never corrupts the buffer; chrono fallback for out-of-range years /
Utf8 timestamp labels keeps one temp String). Anchored aliases (W-MON.., Y-JAN.., Q-anchored) keep the per-label path.

Same-box back-to-back best-of-6, 1M Datetime64 row index (`examples/bench_toperiod`), CARGO_TARGET_DIR per-crate:
| freq | origin/main best | patched best | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| M | 85.36ms | 77.0ms | 1.11x | ~0.27x->0.29x (pandas 22.69ms) |
| Q | 74.19ms | 66.0ms | 1.12x | — |
| D | 118.63ms | 110.9ms | 1.07x | — |
| Y | 52.21ms | 51.1ms | 1.02x | — |
| W | 213.70ms | 181.3ms | 1.18x | ~0.12x->0.14x (pandas 25.75ms) |

ALL FIVE freqs faster (consistent direction ⇒ real, not load noise); the memory-traffic win (1M fewer heap allocs)
exceeds the wall-clock delta and compounds at larger frame sizes / under concurrency. Bit-identical: fp-frame lib
3103 passed / 0 failed / 15 ignored, all 56 test binaries green incl. `to_period_numeric_conformance` (numeric path
== chrono path over a decade w/ boundaries). RESIDUAL (still <1.0x vs pandas, string-floored): the labels are still
Utf8 bytes, not an i64 PeriodIndex; the remaining cost is now the per-label civil/weekly COMPUTE + the input-side
`.labels()` materialization (no public Datetime64 nanos view to iterate raw). Closing fully still needs a Period
index-label type (golden-regen, cross-surface). Anchored W-/Y-/Q- aliases unchanged.

### 2026-06-27 Codex cod-b — Series.to_period shared contiguous-index path: 0.210x -> 0.295x vs pandas (1.40x fp-side)
After the stale direct-Series bypass was rejected above, dug the live `to_period` string-floor gap against current
main (`c60b782ee`). The old bypass regressed because it used a per-label helper and lost the newer contiguous-Utf8
index builder. This lever factors the current `DataFrame::to_period` index conversion into
`period_index_from_datetime_like_index` and routes `Series::to_period` directly through that exact helper, so Series
skips the `to_frame -> DataFrame::to_period -> squeeze` wrapper while preserving the contiguous bytes+offsets Period
label output, Series name, values, categorical metadata, sparse metadata, and index name.

Same-worktree proof with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b rch exec -- cargo run
--release -p fp-frame --example bench_toperiod -- 1000000 M`: current main local best **108.054ms**; patched local
best samples **78.747ms / 76.999ms**; pandas 2.2.3 comparator from the current ledger **22.69ms**. Ratio vs pandas
improves **0.210x -> 0.295x** using the patched best; FP-side speedup is **1.40x**. A remote `hz2` patched sample
also returned **67.284ms**, but the local before/after pair is the comparison proof.

Semantics are shared, not duplicated: `DataFrame::to_period` calls the same helper, so anchored `W-*`, `Y-*`, and
`Q-*` aliases plus unsupported-frequency errors follow one code path. The focused Series guard now asserts the Series
name, index name, and values survive the direct route.

### 2026-06-27 AmberLynx — df.pivot Int64-keys/Float64-values typed fast path: 0.57x -> 1.98x vs pandas (3.0x fp-side)
df.pivot was the biggest non-structural MEASURED loss in the dataframe_ops matrix: fp 66ms vs pandas 43.6ms = 0.57x
@1M (100k distinct rows x 10 cols, unique (r,c) pairs). CAUSE: `DataFrame::pivot` called `.values()` on the index,
columns AND values columns — each materializing a 1M-element `Vec<Scalar>` (3M boxed scalars), then hashed a
`ScalarKey` per row for the row/col position maps + the cell scatter (2M ScalarKey probes). The classic Scalar-
materialization tax. LEVER (`pivot_int64_keys_f64_values`, br-frankenpandas-pvtdk): when index+columns are all-valid
Int64 (`as_i64_slice`) and values all-valid no-NaN Float64 (`as_f64_slice`), read every key/value straight off the
typed slice, dedup+sort unique keys as raw i64, probe position maps with `FxHashMap<i64,u32>` (no ScalarKey), scatter
into the same dense col-major grid, and MOVE a typed `Vec<f64>` into each all-present output column via
`from_f64_values_owned` (Scalar `Null(NaN)` path only for columns with gaps).

Same-box back-to-back best-of-5, fp-bench df_pivot @1M, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| workload | origin/main best | patched best | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 (43.62ms) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| df_pivot 1M (Int64 keys, f64 vals, dense) | 66.11ms | 22.06ms | 3.0x | 0.57x -> 1.98x (WIN) |

Bit-identical: first-seen unique i64 sorted ascending == `scalar_key_cmp` on Int64; row labels `IndexLabel::Int64(k)`,
column labels the decimal string the generic `format!("{v:?}")`+strip produced; present cells `Scalar::Float64(slice[pos])`,
missing the same `Null(NaN)`; all-valid `from_f64_values_owned` == `from_values` for no-NaN Float64. New differential
test `df_pivot_int64_typed_matches_generic_pvtdk` proves the typed path's per-column value matrix == the generic
Scalar path on a SPARSE int64/f64 pivot (covers both the all-present and the missing-cell branch). Conformance GREEN:
fp-frame 40 pivot tests + full lib suite pass. Utf8/mixed-dtype or NaN-bearing pivots keep the generic path unchanged.

### 2026-06-27 AmberLynx — Series.unstack typed Float64 value path: 0.43x -> 0.48x vs pandas (~1.15x fp-side)
After the df.pivot typed lever, df_unstack was the next dataframe_ops loss: fp 57-61ms vs pandas 24.4ms = ~0.43x @1M
(Series with composite Utf8 "r, c" index, r=i/10 x c=i%10 -> 100k x 10). `Series::unstack` already had the dense
col-major grid, but still materialized the values column with `.values()` (1M Scalars) and cloned 1M Scalars into the
output. Applied the same typed lever as pivot (br-frankenpandas-unstk): when the source column is all-valid no-NaN
Float64 (`as_f64_slice`), read cell values off the typed slice (no input Scalar materialization) and MOVE a typed
`Vec<f64>` into each all-present output column via `from_f64_values_owned` (Scalar `Null(NaN)` only for gap columns);
the `.values()` call is now deferred into the non-typed fallback branch.

Same-box back-to-back best-of-5, fp-bench df_unstack @1M, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| workload | origin/main best | patched best | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 (24.37ms) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| df_unstack 1M (Utf8 "r,c" index, f64 vals) | 57.18ms | 50.95ms | ~1.12-1.17x | 0.43x -> 0.48x |

Bit-identical: present cells carry `Scalar::Float64(slice[pos])` (== the original), missing the same `Null(NaN)`,
all-valid `from_f64_values_owned` == `from_values` for no-NaN Float64; the grid/first-wins parse is unchanged. New
test `series_unstack_typed_f64_branches_unstk` covers both the all-present (`from_f64_values_owned`) and gap
(`Null(NaN)`) branches (the existing golden uses Int64 values; `series_unstack_missing` carries a source NaN — neither
reaches the all-valid-Float64 path). Conformance GREEN: fp-frame 8 unstack tests + full lib suite.
RESIDUAL (still <1.0x vs pandas): the cost is now dominated by parsing 1M composite "r, c" Utf8 labels (split_once +
trim + 2x `FxHashMap<String>` probes) — pandas operates on a real 2-level MultiIndex with no string parsing. Closing
needs a native MultiIndex row-label representation (cross-surface), analogous to the to_period i64-PeriodIndex floor.

### 2026-06-27 AmberLynx — NEGATIVE: df.pivot Utf8 keys already 2.3x WIN; joins/groupby/io/resample sweep all WIN
After landing df.pivot Int64 (b456cc4b3) and unstack (c8867fe57), checked whether the OPEN sibling — df.pivot with
Utf8 keys — is a gap. It is NOT. Standalone `bench_pivot_str` (1M rows, Utf8 "r{:07}"/"c{:02}" keys, unique (r,c),
f64 values; same shape as df_pivot): fp best **104-108ms** vs pandas 2.2.3 `df.pivot` **239.08ms** = **2.3x WIN**
(pandas' string-keyed pivot is ~5.5x slower than its int pivot, so fp's generic ScalarKey path already beats it).
The Int64 typed fast path (br-frankenpandas-pvtdk) is NOT needed for Utf8 — do NOT re-chase. (Example removed, not
committed.)

Same-session quiet-box (load ~14) sweep of the rest of the matrix @1M, fp-side fp-bench min vs matched pandas best-of-4
(ratio = pandas/fp, >1 = fp faster) — ALL WIN, no gap found:
| op | fp ms | pandas ms | ratio | | op | fp ms | pandas ms | ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| groupby_rank_str | 68.6 | 251.8 | 3.7x | | df_groupby_widekey_sum | 115.2 | 220.8 | 1.9x |
| groupby_nunique_str | 50.3 | 125.3 | 2.5x | | join_inner_shuffled | 60.3 | 136.3 | 2.3x |
| groupby_multi_str | 37.3 | 74.8 | 2.0x | | csv_read | 59.4 | 1495.3 | 25x |

The measurable surface is dominated. Remaining sub-1.0x ops are all documented cross-surface floors: df_unstack 0.48x
(composite Utf8-key parse / no native MultiIndex), to_period ~0.29x (Utf8 labels / no i64 PeriodIndex), transpose &
to_numpy (2D-block / Vec<Vec> structural). Each needs a representation change (golden-regen, multi-crate), not a
point fix.

### 2026-06-27 AmberLynx — NEGATIVE: two typed-lever extensions are ~0-gain (reverted); where the pivot/unstack lever stops
After the df.pivot (3.0x) and Series.unstack (1.15x) typed-OUTPUT wins, probed two more extensions on the remaining
sub-1.0x / near-parity ops. Both same-box back-to-back best-of-6 @1M, fp-bench, REVERTED (~0-gain):

1. **unstack composite-key temporal cache** (last-seen row/col interned-index, short-circuit the FxHashMap<String>
   probe on a run hit): baseline 56.4ms vs patched 58.2ms — NO gain (marginally slower). The col component changes
   every row (c=i%10) so its cache is pure overhead, and the row strcmp savings don't beat the FxHashMap probe. A
   prior agent already filed the same idea (`stash ZERO-GAIN-revert-TypedDedupCol-temporal`) — do NOT re-try.
2. **to_records typed-input** (`as_f64_slice`/`as_i64_slice` to construct the per-cell Scalar directly, skipping the
   `col.values()` Vec<Scalar> materialization): baseline 79.7ms vs patched 76.7ms = ~1.04x — bench-amortized to ~0.
   `time_us` re-runs to_records on the SAME df, so `col.values()` is OnceLock-cached after iter 1 and min-of-N is
   warm; the input materialization the lever removes is already amortized away. The OUTPUT is `Vec<Vec<Scalar>>`
   (Scalar by contract) so the dominant per-cell Scalar construction is unavoidable. (Both tests pass / bit-identical
   if ever wanted; changes stashed, not landed.)

GENERALIZATION (the boundary of the typed lever): the pivot/unstack 3x came from eliminating output Scalar
CONSTRUCTION via `from_f64_values_owned` (typed Vec<f64> output). It does NOT transfer to (a) Scalar-output-by-
contract ops (to_records/to_dict — output is the cost), (b) parse-bound ops (unstack composite-key — no native
MultiIndex), or (c) bench-amortized input materialization (OnceLock-cached `.values()`). Confirms again: the
measurable surface is dominated; the only real residuals are the representation floors (MultiIndex, i64 PeriodIndex,
2D-block) — each a multi-crate golden-regen project, not a point fix.

### 2026-06-27 AmberLynx — sort_values_single small-size: 10k 0.76x is fixed overhead, NOT the parallel gather (par-floor ~0-gain, reverted)
Swept the matrix at 10k (small-size fixed-overhead is the one dimension unexplored after 5 cycles of 1M sweeps). The
ONLY sub-1.0x non-floored op found: `sort_values_single` @10k — fp 530us vs pandas 403us = **0.76x**. It WINS at the
larger sizes: 100k fp 3641us vs pandas 4076us = **1.12x**, and 1M (well-established). Everything else at 10k WINS
(drop_dups 65x, melt 10.7x, gb_sum 11.5x, stack 2.7x, cumsum 2.6x, value_counts 2.2x, sort_multi 3.6x; unstack 1.04x
≈ parity).

HYPOTHESIS (rejected): the 0.6x came from `reorder_rows_by_positions_unchecked` spawning a `thread::scope` for the
10-column gather via the default 16K-cell `par_map_columns` floor — a pure-bandwidth gather that is L2/L3-resident at
10k/100k, where thread-spawn should be loss (cf `DataFrame::abs`'s 4M floor). Raised the reorder floor to 4M (10k/100k
serial, 1M still threaded). MEASURED same-box back-to-back best-of-4: baseline 10k 530us / 100k 3641us vs patched 10k
531us / 100k 3742us — **~0-gain** (best identical at 10k; baseline slightly FASTER at 100k). The thread-spawn overhead
is already negligible; the earlier ~986us "baseline" was a LOAD-NOISE phantom on a busy box. REVERTED.

The genuine 10k residual is fixed Scalar/radix/frame-construction overhead, and `sort_column.values()` is OnceLock-
amortized across the bench's repeated sorts (so an as_f64_slice input lever is bench-invisible, like the to_records
case). Not a point fix; absolute gap is ~127us on the smallest size while sort wins at 100k/1M. Surface remains
dominated; do NOT re-chase the reorder par-floor for small-size sort.

### 2026-06-27 AmberLynx — to_period hand-rolled ASCII label formatting: 1.37-2.27x fp-side (M 0.36x->0.62x vs pandas)
to_period (the biggest measured gap) emits Utf8 period labels; after the contiguous-Utf8 index + numeric-civil work,
the dominant per-label cost was the `write!(buf, "{y:04}-{m:02}")` machinery — `core::fmt` Formatter dispatch +
`pad_integral` (width/fill/sign branches) paid 1M× per to_period. Replaced every `write!` arm in
`period_label_numeric_into` with hand-rolled ASCII digit pushes (`push_4d`/`push_2d` for `{:04}`/`{:02}`, `push_uint`
for Quarterly's UNPADDED `{}` year, literal digit for the quarter) — bit-identical bytes, no fmt dispatch.

Same-box back-to-back best-of-6, 1M Datetime64 row index (`examples/bench_toperiod`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| freq | baseline (write!) | patched (hand-rolled) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| M | 63.43ms | 36.35ms | 1.75x | 0.36x -> 0.62x (pandas 22.69ms) |
| D | 79.52ms | 34.97ms | 2.27x | — |
| Y | 44.35ms | 32.27ms | 1.37x | — |
| Q | 59.91ms | 33.61ms | 1.78x | — |
| W | 161.07ms | 71.76ms | 2.24x | 0.16x -> 0.36x (pandas 25.75ms) |

The `core::fmt` overhead was ~HALF of to_period's wall time. Bit-identical: differential
`to_period_numeric_conformance` (numeric path == chrono path over a decade incl. boundaries) green; fp-frame 9
to_period lib tests + full suite green. RESIDUAL (still <1.0x vs pandas, unchanged): the labels are still Utf8 bytes,
not an i64 PeriodIndex — closing fully needs a Period index-label type. GENERALIZES: any hot loop formatting fixed-
shape integers (strftime, astype_str, csv/json numeric serialization) pays the same `pad_integral` tax — hand-rolled
ASCII digit writers are a reusable lever.

### 2026-06-27 Codex cod-a - SeriesGroupBy shift/diff periods=1 fast path: 2.8x/2.35x fp-side
Dig path after the measured to_period contiguous-Utf8 win was already on `origin/main`. The biggest old source-
addressable residual still worth testing was SeriesGroupBy shift/diff over dense Int64 keys. Current main had already
landed the key-offset path, but `periods=1` still paid the general ring-buffer cost: per row it did `cnt`, modulo,
`off * periods + slot`, and a usize count update even though the common pandas default only needs one previous value
per group. Added a narrow `periods == 1` branch in the Int64-key direct kernels: `last[off]`, `seen[off]`, one validity
bit, and no ring math. `periods > 1` stays on the existing implementation.

Bench evidence, same checkout and target dir `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a`,
`rch exec` fell open locally because no workers were admissible. Workload: `bench_gb_cum 1000000 1000 {shift,diff}
6` (1M all-valid Float64 values, dense Int64 grouping key, periods=1). Same-box pandas 2.2.3 comparator used the
same generated splitmix-style key/value arrays.

| workload | current main | patched | pandas 2.2.3 | ratio vs pandas | fp-side |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| SeriesGroupBy.shift(1) | 9.967ms | 3.527ms | 28.490ms | 2.86x -> 8.08x | 2.83x |
| SeriesGroupBy.diff(1) | 8.431ms | 3.589ms | 29.100ms | 3.45x -> 8.11x | 2.35x |

Notes: the old ledger's sub-1.0x pandas ratios for this surface are stale under today's same-box pandas comparator,
but the fp-side delta is large and same-worktree. Bit contract is the existing per-group row-order reference:
`shift(1)` emits the previous in-group value; `diff(1)` emits current minus previous; first row per group remains
missing via the same `from_f64_values_with_validity` path.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — strftime hand-rolled ASCII digit writers: 2.05-2.2x fp-side (9.8-10.5x vs pandas)
Direct follow-up to AmberLynx's to_period lever (the prior entry literally named `strftime` as the next loop paying
the same tax). `DatetimeAccessor::strftime`'s clean typed path (all-valid `datetime64[ns]`, no NaT) emitted each `%Y`
/`%m`/`%d`/`%H`/`%M`/`%S` directive via `write!(bytes, "{y:04}")` etc — `core::fmt` Formatter dispatch + `pad_integral`
(width/fill/sign branches) paid per directive per row, 1M× and more for multi-directive formats. Replaced every
`write!` arm with hand-rolled ASCII digit pushes into the `Vec<u8>` byte buffer (`push_4d_bytes`/`push_2d_bytes`,
new siblings of `push_4d`/`push_2d`). Bit-identical: a `datetime64[ns]` year is always in [1677, 2262] (the i64-ns
representable range) so `%Y` is exactly 4 digits like `{:04}`, and m/d/H/M/S are exactly 2 like `{:02}` — the manual
writers produce byte-identical output, no fmt dispatch.

Same-box back-to-back best-of-3, 1M `datetime64[ns]` series (`examples/bench_strftime`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| format | baseline (write!) | patched (hand-rolled) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `%Y-%m-%d` | 91.47ms | 44.54ms | 2.05x | 4.76x -> 9.80x (pandas 436.0ms) |
| `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` | 180.34ms | 81.88ms | 2.20x | 4.77x -> 10.50x (pandas 859.2ms) |

The `core::fmt` overhead was ~HALF of strftime's wall time, same as to_period. Already WON vs pandas before; now wins
by ~2x more. Bit-identical: conformance packets FP-P2D-239 (basic strict) + FP-P2D-310 (null hardened) both green
(`--require-green` exit 0); fp-frame suite green. CONFIRMS the AmberLynx generalization: hand-rolled ASCII digit
writers are a reusable lever for any hot loop formatting fixed-shape integers (next candidates: astype_str, csv/json
numeric serialization).

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — astype(Int64->Utf8) hand-rolled decimal itoa: 2.32x fp-side (10.6x vs pandas)
The third op carrying the AmberLynx/strftime `core::fmt` tax (the strftime entry named `astype_str` as a next
candidate). `Column::astype(Utf8)`'s Int64 fast path wrote each value via `use std::io::Write; write!(bytes, "{v}")`
into a contiguous byte buffer — `io::Write::write_fmt` routes through Formatter construction + the io error path per
row, far heavier than `fmt::Write`. Replaced with `push_i64_decimal`: a two-digit-LUT itoa emitting digit pairs LSB-
first into a 20-byte temp then copying the suffix, `unsigned_abs` for `i64::MIN`. Bit-identical to `v.to_string()`
(what `cast_scalar(Int64, Utf8)` does — pandas spells ints plainly).

Same-box back-to-back best-of-3, 1M Int64 column (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_astype_str`, mixed-magnitude signed
splitmix values), `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | baseline (write!/io::Write) | patched (itoa) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `astype(str)` Int64 1M | 38.53ms | 16.57ms | 2.32x | 4.57x -> 10.6x (pandas 175.9ms) |

Bit-identical: standalone differential `push_i64_decimal` vs `i64::to_string()` over 5M random + all i64 edge cases
(0, ±1, ±99/±100, i64::MIN, i64::MIN+1, i64::MAX) = 0 mismatches; fp-columnar 7 astype unit tests + fp-frame 30
astype tests (incl. `series_astype_string_golden_basic`, `df_astype_all_columns_to_utf8`) green. CONFIRMS the lever
a third time: any hot loop using `write!` into a `Vec<u8>` via `io::Write` to format fixed-shape integers pays the
`write_fmt` tax — hand-rolled ASCII writers are the fix. RESIDUAL: the Float64->Utf8 astype path still calls
`fp_types::float_to_string_for_astype` (shortest round-trip — genuinely hard to hand-roll, left as-is).

### 2026-06-27 Codex cod-b - to_period day-run label cache: M 0.62x -> 1.17x, W 0.36x -> 1.11x vs pandas
Follow-up to the live `Series.to_period` string-floor gap after the shared contiguous-index Series path and hand-rolled
ASCII formatter landed.
The remaining hot cost was not another Series/DataFrame wrapper: hourly Datetime64 indexes repeatedly emitted the
same period label for every row in the same calendar day, so `period_index_from_datetime_like_index` still reran the
Hinnant civil conversion plus fixed-width ASCII digit pushes for 24 adjacent rows with identical M/D/W output. Added
a tiny day-run label cache inside the contiguous Utf8 index builder for date-level frequencies (`Y`, `Q`, `M`, `W`,
`D`, `B`). The cache stores only the just-emitted label for the current Datetime64 day; Utf8 labels and hour/min/sec
frequencies stay on the original direct append path. Output remains byte-identical because cache misses call the same
`append_period_label` helper, and cache hits copy the exact bytes it just appended.

Same-worktree proof, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`, `rch exec` fell open
locally because no worker slots were admissible. Workload: `cargo run --release -p fp-frame --example
bench_toperiod -- 1000000 <freq>` over a 1M hourly Datetime64 index.

| workload | current main | patched | pandas 2.2.3 comparator | ratio vs pandas | fp-side |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Series.to_period("M") | 36.35ms | 19.423ms | 22.69ms | 0.62x -> 1.17x | 1.87x |
| Series.to_period("W") | 71.76ms | 23.102ms | 25.75ms | 0.36x -> 1.11x | 3.11x |
| Series.to_period("D") | 34.97ms | 14.693ms | not rerun in this cycle | - | 2.38x |

Conformance target: same semantics as the existing contiguous label path; validation in this commit runs focused
to_period tests plus full `fp-conformance --release`. Residual: W is still below pandas because FP stores period
labels as Utf8 bytes rather than pandas' compact PeriodIndex ordinals. M now reaches parity on this measured shape;
the next deeper lever remains a real Period index-label type, not more string formatting.

### 2026-06-27 BlackThrush — dt.isocalendar weekday-from-epoch: 0.49x -> 0.62x vs pandas (20% fp-side)
Follow-up dig on the largest remaining measured gap after the typed `dt.isocalendar` fast path. First probe was the
obvious all-valid validity-mask shortcut (build columns with `from_i64_values` when no NaT appears): same-box local
baseline 49.381ms vs patched 88.986ms @1M, REVERTED. The allocation it removes is not the bottleneck, and the extra
invalid-position bookkeeping made the hot all-valid case worse.

Kept lever: typed `isocalendar` already has `dse = ns.div_euclid(NANOS_PER_DAY)`, so ISO weekday can be derived as
`(dse + 3).rem_euclid(7) + 1` because 1970-01-01 was Thursday. This removes the per-row Sakamoto weekday formula
(`y_adj + y_adj/4 - y_adj/100 + y_adj/400 + table + day`) and the month-offset table from the hot loop, while leaving
the civil-date and ISO-week boundary logic unchanged.

Evidence: `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a rch exec -- cargo run --release -p
fp-frame --example bench_dtacc -- 1000000 isocalendar` fell open locally because workers were saturated, so the
comparison uses the immediately preceding same-target local baseline. Current main baseline 49.381ms; patched hot
runs 41.678ms and 39.353ms. Using the established same-workload pandas 2.2.3 comparator from the prior entry
(24.29ms), ratio improves from 0.49x to 0.62x vs pandas; fp-side speedup 1.25x. Residual remains vectorized
date-to-civil arithmetic plus three-column materialization; the cheaper validity construction was negative evidence,
not a keeper.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — format_datetime_ns hand-rolled civil+ASCII (drop chrono): 8.7x fp-side, to_csv datetime 5.1x (13.1x vs pandas)
The fourth and broadest application of the to_period/strftime/astype ASCII-writer lever. `fp_index::format_datetime_ns`
— the shared chokepoint for to_csv datetime columns, repr, to_html, and astype(str)-of-datetime — built a
`chrono::DateTime::from_timestamp_nanos(ns)` then `dt.format("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S").to_string()` plus a
`format!("{subsec:09}")` PER VALUE: chrono DateTime construction + `DelayedFormat` strftime machinery + two String
allocs every row. Replaced with `civil_from_epoch_days` (Hinnant `civil_from_days`, the exact algorithm fp-frame's
strftime fast path already uses) + `div_euclid`/`rem_euclid` time decomposition + hand-rolled `push_4d_str`/
`push_2d_str` + a manual 9-digit trailing-zero-trimmed fraction. No chrono, no `DelayedFormat`, one String alloc.

Same-box best-of, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| bench | baseline (chrono) | patched (hand-rolled) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `format_datetime_ns` 1M (no subsec) | 318.4ms | 36.7ms | 8.67x | — |
| `format_datetime_ns` 1M (subsec) | 405.2ms | 67.3ms | 6.02x | — |
| `to_csv` 1M datetime column | 507.8ms | 99.3ms | 5.11x | 2.57x -> 13.1x (pandas 1303ms) |

Bit-identical: a permanent differential `format_datetime_ns_bit_identical_to_chrono_over_full_range_dtns` compares
the new impl against an inline chrono reference over 3M values stepping the full i64-ns datetime64 range + the
representable bounds / epoch / pre-epoch sub-second edges = byte-for-byte equal; fp-io 146 csv + 45 datetime tests,
fp-index 45 datetime tests, existing `..._dt64fmt` golden all green. chrono's floor semantics for pre-epoch instants
(-0.5s -> `1969-12-31 23:59:59.5`) are reproduced by `div_euclid`/`rem_euclid`. CONFIRMS the lever a fourth time and
extends it from integer formatting to full calendar formatting; the chrono `DelayedFormat` path was ~85% of
format_datetime_ns wall time. GENERALIZES to any remaining chrono `.format().to_string()` per-row loop.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — to_json(records) typed streaming writer: 0.69x LOSS -> 5.35x WIN vs pandas (7.7x fp-side)
A genuine measured LOSS (not in the standard bench harness): `write_json_string(Records)` materialized a full
`serde_json::Value` tree — a `serde_json::Map` (BTreeMap) PER ROW, a `name.clone()` key PER CELL, a per-cell `Scalar`
(`c.value(row_idx)`) and `Value` — then serialized it. 1M×2-col = millions of allocs; fp 516ms vs pandas 357ms = 0.69x.
Added `try_write_json_records_typed`: a streaming writer over all-valid `Int64`/`Float64`/`Bool` columns that writes
JSON bytes straight into one String — pre-serialized escaped keys (reused every row), `append_i64_decimal` itoa for
ints, and serde's OWN `CompactFormatter::write_f64` into a reusable scratch for floats (so the exponent spelling,
e.g. `1e+20`, is byte-identical — raw `ryu::format_finite` gives `1e20` and would diverge). Non-finite f64 -> `null`,
matching `scalar_to_json`. Falls back to the serde tree (`write_json_records_serde`) on Utf8/null/promotion columns.

Same-box best-of-3, 1M rows × {Int64, Float64} (`fp-io/examples/bench_to_json`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | baseline (serde tree) | patched (streaming) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `to_json(orient="records")` 1M | 516.0ms | 66.8ms | 7.72x | 0.69x -> 5.35x (pandas 357.4ms) |

Bit-identical: differential `to_json_records_typed_fast_path_bit_identical_to_serde` compares the typed path against
the serde reference over an edge-laden frame (i64::MIN/MAX, signed-zero, integer-valued/huge/tiny/±Inf floats, a
JSON-escaped column name), a -Inf frame, an empty frame, a Utf8-forces-fallback frame, and a 2000-row LCG sweep —
all byte-for-byte equal; fp-io 48 json tests green. The serde-tree allocation was ~87% of to_json's wall time.
RESIDUAL: Columns/Index/Split/Values orients still build the serde tree (Records is the pandas default + most common).

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — to_jsonl typed streaming writer: 1.02x parity -> 5.5x WIN vs pandas (5.44x fp-side)
Direct sibling of the to_json(records) win: `write_jsonl_string` (`to_json(orient='records', lines=True)`) had the
identical serde-tree antipattern — a `serde_json::Map` per row, `name.clone()` key per cell, per-cell `Scalar`+`Value`,
and `serde_json::to_string` PER ROW — joined by `\n`. Generalized `try_write_json_records_typed` with an `as_jsonl`
flag: same streaming body, but rows are `\n`-joined with no enclosing `[ ]`. Bit-identical to the prior serde output
(same pre-serialized keys, `append_i64_decimal` ints, serde `CompactFormatter::write_f64` floats, non-finite -> null).

Same-box best-of-3, 1M rows × {Int64, Float64} (`fp-io/examples/bench_to_jsonl`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | baseline (serde tree) | patched (streaming) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `to_jsonl` 1M | 359.2ms | 66.0ms | 5.44x | 1.02x -> 5.53x (pandas 365.1ms) |

Bit-identical: the `to_json_records_typed_fast_path_bit_identical_to_serde` differential now also asserts JSONL vs a
serde Map-per-row reference over every frame (edge floats incl ±Inf, escaped key, empty, Utf8 fallback, 2000-row LCG
sweep); fp-io 48 json tests green. Records + JSONL (the two pandas `records`/`lines` spellings) now share one typed
writer. RESIDUAL unchanged: Columns/Index/Split/Values orients still build the serde tree.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — to_json(columns) typed streaming writer: 0.39x LOSS -> 4.66x WIN vs pandas (11.9x fp-side)
The WORST measured to_json orient (a survey found Columns 0.39x and Index 0.63x both LOSE pandas; Values 1.78x / Split
2.13x / Records already won). The `Columns` serde arm built `{col: {idx: val}}` by re-running `index_label_json_key`
(label `to_string` + serde quote) for EVERY cell of EVERY column (n×k) into a nested `serde_json::Map` per column.
Added `try_write_json_columns_typed`: pre-serialize the n inner index-label keys ONCE into a single contiguous buffer
(+ offsets), reused across all columns; for the common all-Int64-unique index, keys are hand-rolled `"` + itoa + `":`
straight from `int64_label_values()` (no `labels()` IndexLabel materialization, no per-key alloc); values via the
shared `append_typed_json_value`. Bails to the serde tree on non-typed columns or COLLIDING serialized keys (e.g.
`Int64(1)` vs `Utf8("1")` both spell `"1"` — the serde path errors there, so the fast path must not swallow it).

Two-step measurement (`fp-io/examples/bench_to_json 1000000 columns`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`, best-of-3:
| step | time | vs pandas 375.2ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| baseline (serde Map-of-Maps) | 958.6ms | 0.39x |
| naive (Vec<String> idxkeys, 1M allocs) | 617.2ms | 0.61x (REVERTED in-flight) |
| final (contiguous keybuf + itoa + int64 view) | 80.5ms | **4.66x** |

11.9x fp-side end state. The 1M per-key `String` allocs + `labels()` materialization were the residual after the
nested-Map removal; the contiguous buffer + direct i64 view closed it. Bit-identical: the json differential now also
asserts Columns vs a from-scratch serde Map-of-Maps reference over every frame (edge floats, escaped key, empty, Utf8
fallback, 2000-row LCG sweep) + the existing `json_columns_write_duplicate_index_rejects` still rejects via fallback;
fp-io 48 json tests green. RESIDUAL: the `Index` orient (0.63x) still builds the serde tree — same lever applies next.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — to_json(index) typed streaming writer: 0.63x LOSS -> 8.53x WIN vs pandas (13.5x fp-side)
The last losing to_json orient (the columns entry's flagged residual). `Index` is the transpose of `columns` —
`{idx: {col: val}}` — and the serde arm built a `serde_json::Map` per ROW plus an index-label outer key per row.
Added `try_write_json_index_typed` reusing the shared `build_json_index_key_buffer` (the n outer index-label keys
pre-serialized once into a contiguous buffer, hand-rolled `"`+itoa+`":` off `int64_label_values()` for the common
all-Int64-unique index) + the k inner column keys reused every row + `append_typed_json_value`. Bails to serde on a
duplicate index key or non-typed column.

Same-box best-of-3, 1M rows × {Int64, Float64} (`fp-io/examples/bench_to_json 1000000 index`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | baseline (serde tree) | patched (streaming) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `to_json(index)` 1M | 1197.6ms | 88.5ms | 13.53x | 0.63x -> 8.53x (pandas 755.4ms) |

Bit-identical: the json differential now also asserts Index vs a from-scratch serde Map-of-row-Maps reference over
every frame; fp-io 48 json tests green. ALL FIVE to_json orients (records/columns/index/values/split) + jsonl now WIN
vs pandas — the to_json surface is fully un-lost (records 5.35x, columns 4.66x, index 8.53x, values 1.78x, split
2.13x, jsonl 5.53x). The serde `Value`-tree was the universal culprit; the typed streaming writers retire it.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — to_json typed writers extended to Datetime64 columns: 0.72x LOSS -> 6.38x WIN vs pandas (8.9x fp-side)
After the records/columns/index/jsonl typed writers landed, ANY Datetime64 column still forced the WHOLE frame onto
the serde-tree fallback (the typed extractor only knew Int64/Float64/Bool), so a realistic frame with a timestamp
column re-lost pandas. Added a `JCol::DtMs` arm: a Datetime64 column with no validity-mask nulls is emitted as
epoch-MILLISECOND integers (`v / 1_000_000`, truncating toward zero) with the `NaT` sentinel (i64::MIN) → `null` —
byte-identical to `scalar_to_json(Datetime64)` (pandas default `date_format='epoch', date_unit='ms'`). Gated on
`!has_nulls()`: `from_datetime64_values` keeps NaT AS DATA with an all-valid mask (handled inline), while a
genuine validity-null column bails to serde. (Timedelta64 left to the serde path — its `from_values` backing marks
NaT as a validity-null, an untested combination; Datetime64 is the common case.)

Same-box best-of-3, 1M rows × {Int64, Datetime64} (`fp-io/examples/bench_to_json_dt`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | baseline (serde fallback) | patched (typed) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `to_json(records)` +dt 1M | 480.0ms | 54.1ms | 8.87x | 0.72x -> 6.38x (pandas 344.8ms) |

Bit-identical: the json differential's main frame now carries a Datetime64 column with a NaT + pre-epoch negative ns
(records/jsonl/columns/index all asserted vs serde); fp-io 48 json tests green. The typed JSON writers now cover the
four common column dtypes (i64/f64/bool/datetime) across all five orients + jsonl — a stray timestamp column no longer
silently reverts the frame to the slow path. Confirmed reads are NOT a gap: read_csv 37ms vs pandas 176ms (4.76x),
read_json 473ms vs pandas 1030ms (2.18x) — both already WIN, no action taken.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — to_json typed writers extended to contiguous Utf8 columns: 0.65x LOSS -> 7.7x WIN vs pandas (11.9x fp-side)
The last common column dtype not on the typed JSON path: a Utf8 column forced the whole frame onto the serde tree
(materializing a `Scalar::Utf8` clone + `Value::String` per cell), so a frame with a string column lost pandas. Added
`JCol::U(bytes, offsets)` over the contiguous Utf8 backing `as_utf8_contiguous` exposes (what read_csv / string ops
produce; the `validity.all()` it requires guarantees every row is a present string). Each cell is written by
`append_json_string`: serde escapes ONLY `"`, `\`, and control bytes 0x00–0x1F (multi-byte UTF-8 passes through), so
the no-escape common case is a single `"`+raw+`"` push and only an escape-bearing string deopts to
`serde_json::to_string`. Byte-identical to `scalar_to_json(Utf8)`. (A `Vec<Scalar>` Utf8 backing — e.g. from
`from_values` — still bails to serde; the contiguous backing is the read/op path.)

Same-box best-of-3, 1M rows × {Int64, contiguous Utf8 `item_<k>`} (`fp-io/examples/bench_to_json_str`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | baseline (serde fallback) | patched (typed) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `to_json(records)` +str 1M | 558.96ms | 47.0ms | 11.9x | 0.65x -> 7.71x (pandas 362.5ms) |

Bit-identical: the json differential gained a contiguous-Utf8 frame whose strings cover the no-escape fast path AND
every serde escape case (quote, backslash, `\n`, `\t`, control 0x01, accented + emoji multi-byte) — asserted across
records/jsonl/columns/index vs serde; fp-io 48 json tests green. The typed JSON writers now cover ALL common column
dtypes (i64/f64/bool/datetime/utf8) across every orient + jsonl; the serde `Value`-tree is reached only by genuinely
mixed/null/exotic columns. This closes the to_json write surface: no benched column-dtype × orient combination loses.

### 2026-06-27 BlackThrush — dt.isocalendar ordinal ISO week: 0.50x -> 0.54x vs pandas (1.09x fp-side)
Follow-up on the largest remaining non-structural measured gap after the typed `dt.isocalendar` path. The prior path
still derived civil year/month/day, day-of-year, leap status, and 53-week clamps per row. This pass switches the typed
Datetime64 path to the ISO ordinal identity: ISO year is the civil year of the week Thursday, and ISO week is the
distance from the Monday of ISO week 1. That removes month/day/day-of-year work while preserving the existing NaT
validity mask behavior and 53-week year semantics.

Same current-origin worktree (`0881afa1c`), same target dir
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a`, `rch exec` fell open locally because workers were
saturated, command `cargo run --release -p fp-frame --example bench_dtacc -- 1000000 isocalendar`; pandas 2.2.3
comparator uses the identical 1M hourly timestamp fixture:
| workload | ORIG best | patched best | pandas best | ratio vs pandas | fp-side |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `dt.isocalendar` 1M | 49.089ms | 45.092ms | 24.314ms | 0.50x -> 0.54x | 1.09x |

Bit-equivalence guard: before landing, the ordinal formula was checked against the existing civil formula over a
400k-day contiguous range plus 5M randomized epoch days. Focused fp-frame isocalendar tests and the full
fp-conformance crate were run in release mode. Residual remains output/DataFrame construction plus pandas' vectorized
datetime core; another same-formula scalar tweak is unlikely to close the remaining gap.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — to_json(values) typed streaming writer: 1.78x -> 11.3x WIN vs pandas (6.36x fp-side)
The fifth and last to_json orient still on the serde tree. `Values` is `[[v,v],...]` (row-major arrays, no keys) — the
simplest orient — but still built a `Vec<serde_json::Value>` per row + a per-cell `Scalar`/`Value`. Added
`try_write_json_values_typed` reusing `extract_typed_value_columns` (i64/f64/bool/datetime/utf8) + the shared
`append_typed_json_value`, emitting `[` + comma-joined cell values + `]` per row. Bails to serde on any non-typed
column. Bit-identical to the serde `Values` arm (column-order values, same per-dtype spellings).

Same-box best-of-3, 1M rows × {Int64, Float64} (`fp-io/examples/bench_to_json 1000000 values`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | baseline (serde tree) | patched (streaming) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `to_json(values)` 1M | 344.1ms | 54.0ms | 6.36x | 1.78x -> 11.3x (pandas 613.4ms) |

Bit-identical: the json differential now also asserts Values vs a from-scratch serde array-of-arrays reference over
every test frame (numeric edges, datetime+NaT, contiguous-Utf8 escape cases, empty, fallback, LCG sweep); fp-io 48
json tests green. ALL FIVE to_json orients (records/columns/index/values/split) + jsonl now use typed streaming
writers across every common column dtype. Split still builds its `data` arrays via serde (its columns/index header
arrays are tiny); the dominant `data` section is the same row-major shape as Values and is the remaining follow-up.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — to_json(split) typed streaming writer: 2.13x -> 8.59x WIN vs pandas (4.04x fp-side); to_json surface fully typed
The last to_json orient on the serde tree (the Values entry's flagged follow-up). `Split` is
`{"columns":[...],"index":[...],"data":[[...]]}`; the dominant `data` section is the same row-major arrays as Values.
Added `try_write_json_split_typed`: `columns` via serde over the (few) header strings, `index` hand-rolled (itoa per
label for the common all-Int64 index, `index_label_to_json`+serde otherwise — bare JSON values, not keys), `data` via
the shared `append_json_row_arrays` (factored out of the Values writer). Object keys emitted columns/index/data to
match `preserve_order` insertion order. Bails to serde on any non-typed column.

Same-box best-of-3, 1M rows × {Int64, Float64} (`fp-io/examples/bench_to_json 1000000 split`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | baseline (serde tree) | patched (streaming) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `to_json(split)` 1M | 316.5ms | 78.3ms | 4.04x | 2.13x -> 8.59x (pandas 672.8ms) |

Bit-identical: the json differential now also asserts Split vs a from-scratch serde `{columns,index,data}` reference
over every test frame; fp-io 48 json tests green. SURFACE CLOSED: ALL five to_json orients
(records/columns/index/values/split) AND jsonl now use typed streaming writers across every common column dtype
(i64/f64/bool/datetime/utf8). The serde `Value`-tree is reached only by genuinely mixed/null/exotic columns. Final
vs-pandas scorecard for the to_json write surface (1M, numeric): records 5.35x, columns 4.66x, index 8.53x, values
11.3x, split 8.59x, jsonl 5.53x — every one a WIN; three started as outright LOSSES (records 0.69x, columns 0.39x,
index 0.63x) plus the datetime (0.72x) and utf8 (0.65x) column-dtype losses, all now closed.

### 2026-06-27 BlackThrush — Series.unstack numeric flat-label parser: ORIG 58.712ms -> 22.634ms (2.59x fp-side)
The measured `df_unstack` gap was not in value scatter after the existing typed Float64 branch; it was still paying
per-label string splitting/trimming and two `FxHashMap<String, usize>` lookups for the benchmark's canonical flattened
numeric labels (`"row, col"`). Added a guarded parser for exact non-negative decimal `"u64, u64"` Utf8 labels that
factorizes row/column codes as integers and only converts distinct output row/column labels back to strings. Any
non-Utf8 label, non-canonical spacing, sign, empty side, overflow, or leading-zero multi-digit token falls back to the
old string path, preserving public string semantics.

Same target dir `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`; command:
`rch exec -- cargo run -p fp-bench --release -- --category dataframe_ops --workload df_unstack --size 1M --dtype float64 --json`.

| workload | ORIG current main | patched | fp-side | vs pandas note |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `df_unstack` 1M float64 | 58.712ms best (`rch exec` fell open locally) | 22.634ms best (`rch exec` fell open locally after final cleanup; earlier remote `hz2` best was 20.011ms) | 2.59x | prior pandas 2.2.3 row was 24.37ms, so this moves the workload from ~0.42-0.48x to ~1.08x vs that comparator |

Guards: `cargo test -p fp-frame --release unstack` passed (9 focused tests including a leading-zero fallback test);
`cargo bench -p fp-frame` passed after Cargo rejected the literal invalid `cargo bench --release -p fp-frame` form;
`cargo test -p fp-conformance --release` passed. `cargo check -p fp-frame --all-targets` passed with existing example
unused-import warnings. `cargo clippy -p fp-frame --all-targets -- -D warnings` is blocked before this crate by an
existing `fp-columnar` lint; `cargo clippy -p fp-frame --lib --no-deps -- -D warnings` shows only the known broad
`fp-frame` lint backlog after removing the one local `unstack` loop warning. `cargo fmt -p fp-frame --check` is blocked
by pre-existing formatting drift in examples/tests and unrelated old `lib.rs` hunks. Bounded UBS
`timeout 180s ubs crates/fp-frame/src/lib.rs` timed out without a focused finding, matching the known broad inventory.

### 2026-06-27 BlackThrush - dt.isocalendar day-run fill: 0.54x -> 1.18x WIN vs pandas (2.17x fp-side vs ORIG)
The typed `dt.isocalendar` path still spent scalar work per timestamp even when the 1M hourly fixture only changes
ISO output once per epoch day. Applied the self-adjusting/day-run lever: compute the ISO tuple once for a contiguous
same-day run, fill the year/week/day slices for that run, and allocate the validity bitmap lazily only when a NaT is
actually observed. This preserves the existing NaT semantics and the ordinal ISO formula while removing repeated
weekday/week-year arithmetic and the all-valid bitmap write from the no-null common path.

Same target dir `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a`; ORIG is current-main worktree
state `19af82367` before the lever, command
`rch exec -- cargo run --release -p fp-frame --example bench_dtacc -- 1000000 isocalendar`; pandas 2.2.3 comparator
uses the identical 1M hourly timestamp fixture:
| workload | ORIG best | patched best | pandas best | ratio vs pandas | fp-side |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `dt.isocalendar` 1M | 44.715ms | 20.627ms | 24.314ms | 0.54x -> 1.18x | 2.17x |

Validation: focused `fp-frame dt_isocalendar` release tests green; full `fp-conformance` release crate green; valid
per-crate `cargo bench -p fp-frame` green. The literal requested `cargo bench --release -p fp-frame` form was also
run and rejected by Cargo because `bench` has no `--release` argument, so the valid per-crate bench command above is
the landed gate.

### 2026-06-28 BlackThrush - SeriesGroupBy shift/diff byte seen-state: 1.25x/1.12x fp-side vs ORIG
After the bench-worktree scan, every measured unlanded worktree candidate was either already patch-equivalent on
`origin/main` or explicitly dominated in this ledger. The current source-addressable residual I dug was the
`periods == 1` dense Int64-key `SeriesGroupBy.shift/diff` path: the prior fast path still used `Vec<bool>` for the
per-group seen state, so the hottest branch went through packed-bit proxy loads/stores. Replaced that local seen state
with byte flags (`Vec<u8>`), preserving the same per-group first-row invalidity contract while avoiding bit-proxy
traffic in the row loop.

Same target dir `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`; `rch exec` fell open locally
because workers were saturated/no admissible slots. ORIG is detached clean `origin/main` at `3c20b754d`; patched is this
commit's worktree. Command:
`rch exec -- cargo run --release -p fp-frame --example bench_gb_cum -- 1000000 1000 {shift,diff} 8`.

| workload | ORIG best | patched best | ratio vs ORIG | pandas note |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `SeriesGroupBy.shift(1)` | 5.389818ms | 4.312075ms | 1.25x | prior same-workload pandas comparator 28.490ms, so both already win |
| `SeriesGroupBy.diff(1)` | 4.041242ms | 3.618641ms | 1.12x | prior same-workload pandas comparator 29.100ms, so both already win |

The lever is intentionally narrow: `periods > 1`, non-dense keys, null/NaN values, and non-float fall back to the
existing paths. Validation: focused `fp-frame --release gbcum` tests green (4/4); full `fp-conformance --release`
crate green; valid per-crate `cargo bench -p fp-frame` green; per-crate `cargo check -p fp-frame --all-targets`
green on remote `hz2` with pre-existing example unused-import warnings. The literal requested `cargo bench --release
-p fp-frame` form was also run and rejected by Cargo because `bench` has no `--release` argument. `cargo fmt -p
fp-frame --check` is blocked by pre-existing example formatting drift outside this hunk; bounded
`timeout 180s ubs crates/fp-frame/src/lib.rs` timed out without a focused finding, matching the known broad inventory.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — to_csv typed FastCol path extended to Datetime64: 1.95x fp-side (6.9x -> 13.5x vs pandas)
Mirror of the to_json datetime fix on the CSV side. `try_write_csv_typed`'s `FastCol` only knew F/I/B/U, so ANY
Datetime64 column made the whole frame `return None` and revert to the generic `csv`-crate writer — dragging the
int/float columns off their typed fast paths too. Added `FastCol::Dt(&[i64], DatetimeCsvFormat)`: gated `!has_nulls()`
(NaT-as-data kept by the all-valid backing renders as na_rep inline, matching `scalar_to_csv_cell`), formatted by the
already-fast `format_datetime_csv` (hand-rolled civil, no chrono) and routed through `append_csv_minimal_field`
(QUOTE_MINIMAL), with the same sole-empty-na `""` quoting as the F NaN arm.

Same-box best-of-3, 1M rows × {Int64, Float64, Datetime64} (`fp-io/examples/bench_to_csv_mixed`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | baseline (generic writer) | patched (typed FastCol) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `to_csv` mixed+dt 1M | 323.3ms | 166.1ms | 1.95x | 6.9x -> 13.5x (pandas 2236ms) |

Already beat pandas (its to_csv is slow); the lever keeps a mixed datetime frame on the typed path instead of
reverting every column to the generic writer. Bit-identical: new differential `to_csv_typed_handles_datetime_column
_without_fallback_dtcsv` (typed output == hand-verified expected incl. NaT→na_rep and the column-uniform full-timestamp
form) + fp-io 148 csv tests green. The typed CSV writer now covers i64/f64/bool/utf8/datetime, matching the typed JSON
writers' dtype coverage.

### 2026-06-28 BlackThrush - resample('min') typed Datetime64 bin labels: 0.148x -> 0.647x vs pandas (4.38x fp-side vs ORIG)
The prior sub-daily resample fast path still formatted every output bin into a Utf8 timestamp label. On the 1M
minute-spaced fixture, `resample('min')` emits 1M bins, so label formatting dominated the otherwise single-pass typed
mean/sum reducer. Applied the pandas-aligned label lever: the typed sub-daily reducer now emits
`IndexLabel::Datetime64(bin_start_ns)` directly from the already-computed bin start, avoiding the per-bin civil
conversion and `String` allocation while matching pandas' DatetimeIndex model more closely than the old Utf8 labels.

Same target dir `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a`; `rch exec` fell open locally due
worker saturation. ORIG is current-main worktree state `3c20b754d` before the lever, command
`rch exec -- cargo run -p fp-frame --example bench_resample --release -- 1000000 min mean`; pandas 2.2.3 comparator
uses the identical 1M minute-spaced timestamp fixture:
| workload | ORIG best | patched best | pandas best | ratio vs pandas | fp-side |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `resample('min').mean()` 1M | 312.357ms | 71.331ms | 46.156ms | 0.148x -> 0.647x | 4.38x |

Validation: focused `series_resample_subdaily_typed_fast_path_emits_datetime64_labels` release test green; full
`fp-conformance` release crate green; valid per-crate `cargo bench -p fp-frame` green. The literal requested
`cargo bench --release -p fp-frame` form was also run and rejected by Cargo because `bench` has no `--release`
argument, so the valid per-crate bench command above is the landed gate. Residual is output-index allocation and
1M-bin result construction; this is a KEEP PARTIAL, not a full pandas win.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — read_jsonl: move-not-clone parsed Maps + drop redundant key clones (1.13-1.34x fp-side)
`read_jsonl_str` was the weakest-winning read op (1.43x vs pandas). Two bit-identical wastes removed: (1) each line's
parsed `serde_json::Map` was `obj.clone()`d into `all_rows` — now the object is MOVED out of the per-line `Value`
(`Value::Object(map) => all_rows.push(map)`), skipping a deep copy (every key String + value) per row; (2) the
column-name union pass did `set.insert(key.clone())` for EVERY key of EVERY row — now `contains` guards the clone, so
a uniform JSONL stream (every line sharing keys, the `to_json(lines=True)` shape) clones each key once total instead
of once per row (saves O(n·k) String clones).

Box was peer-contended this cycle so the ratio is a conservative range, not a point. Same-target
`fp-io/examples/bench_read jsonl`, 1M rows × {Int64, Float64}, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| window | baseline (ORIG) | patched | fp-side |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| quiet | 545ms | 483ms | 1.13x |
| busier back-to-back | 701ms | 525ms | 1.34x |

Conservative ≥1.13x; vs pandas 782ms moves 1.43x -> ~1.6x. The change removes provable O(n·k) clone work (not a
phantom), so it can only help or be neutral. Bit-identical: fp-io 9 jsonl tests green (read/write round-trip, union
keys, hostile-row cap). NOTE: perf reads taken on a contended box — the absolute ms are noisy; the win is the removed
allocations, confirmed logically + by every same-load pair showing patched < ORIG.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — nunique wide/sparse Int64 open-addressing set: 0.97x LOSS -> 6.0x WIN vs pandas (6.2x fp-side); KHASH FLOOR BROKEN
The long-standing "wide-i64 high-card khash floor" (memory: factorize 0.32x, value_counts/nunique — FxHashMap vs khash;
"custom open-addr i64 table UNTRIED"). `nunique` had a dense direct-address bitset for bounded ranges but fell to
`nannunique` (Scalar materialization + FxHashSet) for SPARSE wide i64 — at PARITY/slight-loss vs pandas' khash. Added
`count_distinct_i64_wide`: a purpose-built open-addressing set (linear probing, inline i64 keys, ~0.5 load, Fibonacci
hash, i64::MIN empty-sentinel tracked separately) scanned straight over the raw `&[i64]` — no Scalar boxing, no
SwissTable control-byte/tombstone overhead. Wired into `nunique_with_dropna`'s typed path (dense bitset kept for
bounded ranges; new set for wide).

Same-box best-of-3, 5M Int64, ~5M distinct sparse full-range values (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_hashops 5000000
nunique wide`), `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | baseline (FxHashSet+Scalar) | patched (open-addr) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `nunique` wide-i64 5M | 765.6ms | 123.4ms | 6.21x | 0.97x -> 6.00x (pandas 740.8ms) |
| `nunique` dense-i64 5M (unchanged) | 10.0ms | 10.0ms | 1.0x | wins (pandas 140ms) |

Bit-identical: new `nunique_wide_i64_open_addressing_matches_reference` (open-addr count == std HashSet count over 20k
LCG sparse values + forced dups + i64::MIN sentinel + i64::MAX) + fp-columnar 5 nunique tests green. The lever
GENERALIZES to the other khash-floor ops over wide i64 — `duplicated` (already 1.47x, would widen), `factorize`
(0.32x, the big one), `value_counts`, `unique` — all of which can reuse this open-addressing table. nunique landed
first as the clean single-output case; factorize/value_counts are the high-value follow-ups.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — factorize wide/sparse Int64 open-addressing map: 0.57x LOSS -> 1.25x WIN vs pandas (2.2x fp-side)
The big khash-floor op (memory: factorize wide-i64 0.32x — the worst). Same lever as the nunique win, extended to a
value→code MAP. `factorize` had a dense direct-address code table for bounded ranges but fell to `FxHashMap` +
`Scalar` materialization for SPARSE wide i64. Added `factorize_i64_wide`: open-addressing `i64 -> u32 code` map
(linear probing, inline keys + parallel u32 codes, ~0.67 load, Fibonacci hash, i64::MIN empty-sentinel tracked
separately) over the raw `&[i64]`, assigning first-seen codes — no Scalar input boxing, no FxHashMap overhead. Wired
into `factorize_with_options`' typed branch (dense table kept for bounded ranges; new map for wide); the shared
`sort` step and Scalar code/unique output are unchanged.

Same-box back-to-back best-of-3, 5M Int64 ~5M distinct sparse full-range (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_hashops
5000000 factorize wide`), `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | baseline (FxHashMap+Scalar) | patched (open-addr map) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `factorize` wide-i64 5M | 1327.1ms | 603.4ms | 2.20x | 0.57x -> 1.25x (pandas 756.6ms) |

Bit-identical: new `factorize_wide_i64_open_addressing_matches_reference` (codes AND uniques vs an O(n²) first-seen
reference over 120 LCG trials from a full-range value pool incl. i64::MIN/MAX, BOTH sort modes) + fp-columnar 9
factorize tests green. RESIDUAL: factorize's `codes` output is still a `Vec<Scalar::Int64>` (5M × 32 B) — the hashing
floor is gone, the remaining cost is output Scalar boxing (a typed Int64 codes column via `from_i64_values` is the
next lever, and applies to the dense path too). The open-addressing table has now broken the khash floor for both
nunique and factorize; value_counts is the remaining wide-i64 consumer.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — value_counts wide-i64 open-addressing tally: REVERTED (~0-gain; sort/output-bound, NOT hash-bound)
After the nunique (6.0x) and factorize (1.25x) open-addressing wins, value_counts looked like the third wide-i64
khash-floor consumer. Built `value_counts_i64_wide` (open-addressing `i64 -> tally-index` map, same shape as
`factorize_i64_wide`) and wired it into `value_counts_with_options`' typed path. MEASURED same-box back-to-back,
best-of-3, 5M sparse i64 (~5M distinct), `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | ORIG (FxHashMap) | patched (open-addr) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `value_counts` wide-i64 5M | 682-704ms | 706-735ms | ~0.97x (REGRESSION) | ~1.35x both (pandas 949.7ms) |

The patched tally was consistently EQUAL-OR-SLOWER than the FxHashMap path. UNLIKE nunique/factorize, value_counts on
high-cardinality data is NOT hash-bound: with ~5M distinct it must (1) stable-sort 5M `(Scalar, usize)` pairs by count
and (2) materialize 5M-element value+count output columns — those dominate, and the hash tally is a small fraction, so
a faster tally is invisible (and the extra 64-bit-key table init adds a touch of overhead). 32 value_counts tests
stayed green, but the change was REVERTED per the ~0-gain rule. LESSON: the open-addressing lever pays off only when
the hash probe is the bottleneck (nunique: scalar count, no sort/large-output; factorize: codes output but hash-heavy).
value_counts high-card is dominated by sort + dual-column output — a different lever (typed Int64 value output +
radix/count-based top-k instead of full sort) would be needed, not a faster hash.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — factorize typed Int64 codes output (Vec<i64>, not Vec<Scalar>): 1.34x further fp-side (1.24x -> 1.66x vs pandas)
The residual flagged after the factorize open-addressing win: `codes` was a `Vec<Scalar::Int64>` (n × 32 B box) for
EVERY path (dense, wide, hash). Since factorize codes are always plain Int64 (-1 for NA), built `codes` as a typed
`Vec<i64>` throughout — `factorize_i64_wide` now returns `Vec<i64>`, all three branches push raw i64, the sort remap
operates on i64, and the codes column is emitted via `Self::from_i64_values(codes)` instead of
`Self::new(DType::Int64, Vec<Scalar>)`. Drops the 5M × 32 B output boxing + revalidation.

Same-box back-to-back best-of-3, 5M sparse i64 (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_hashops 5000000 factorize wide`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | Scalar codes (prev commit) | typed i64 codes | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `factorize` wide-i64 5M | 611.6ms | 456.5ms | 1.34x | 1.24x -> 1.66x (pandas 756.6ms) |
| `factorize` dense-i64 5M | — | 135.2ms | — | ~5.6x (pandas ~757ms) |

Applies to ALL factorize paths (dense benefits too). Cumulative wide-i64 factorize: 1327ms (pre-open-addr) -> 456ms
= 2.9x fp-side, 0.57x LOSS -> 1.66x WIN. Bit-identical: codes values unchanged (plain i64, -1 NA), only the column
backing is now lazy-int64 instead of Scalar — fp-columnar 60 factorize/unique/value_counts tests + fp-frame 12
factorize tests green. RESIDUAL: `uniques` for high-card i64 is still `Vec<Scalar::Int64>` (could be from_i64_values
when self.dtype==Int64), a smaller follow-up (uniques ≤ distinct, often < n).

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — unique wide/sparse Int64 open-addressing dedup: 0.74x LOSS -> 3.8x WIN vs pandas (5.1x fp-side)
Third khash-floor consumer (after nunique + factorize). `unique` had a dense direct-address dedup for bounded ranges
but fell to `FxHashSet<Key>` + `Scalar` materialization for SPARSE wide i64. Added `unique_i64_wide`: the same
open-addressing set as `count_distinct_i64_wide` but COLLECTING each value's first-seen occurrence into a `Vec<i64>`
(emitted via `from_i64_values`) — no Scalar boxing on input OR output, no FxHashSet overhead. i64::MIN empty-sentinel
emitted at its first-seen position via a flag.

Same-box back-to-back best-of-3, 5M sparse i64 ~5M distinct (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_hashops 5000000 unique
wide`), `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | baseline (FxHashSet+Scalar) | patched (open-addr) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `unique` wide-i64 5M | 830.9ms | 162.7ms | 5.11x | 0.74x -> 3.78x (pandas 614.4ms) |

Bit-identical: new `unique_wide_i64_open_addressing_matches_reference` (first-seen distinct vs insertion-ordered std
HashSet ref over full-range pool incl. i64::MIN/MAX, 120 LCG trials) + fp-columnar 22 unique tests green. KHASH FLOOR
NOW BROKEN ACROSS nunique (6.0x), factorize (1.66x), unique (3.8x) — all three wide-i64 hash ops flipped from
parity/loss to multi-x wins by the open-addressing i64 table. value_counts is the only wide-i64 hash op left on the
generic path, and it's correctly NOT a hash problem (sort/output-bound, documented REVERT above).

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — unique Datetime64 reuses open-addressing i64 dedup: 0.74x LOSS -> 4.1x WIN vs pandas (5.8x fp-side)
Datetime64 is i64-ns-backed but `unique`'s typed paths only check `as_i64_slice` (Int64-only), so a datetime column
(inherently sparse/high-card — the common time-series case) fell to `FxHashSet<Key>` + Scalar materialization. Added a
Datetime64 branch reusing `unique_i64_wide` over the raw `as_datetime64_slice` ns, re-wrapped via
`from_datetime64_values`. Gated `!has_nulls()` AND `!data.contains(&i64::MIN)`: the generic path SKIPS NaT, so any
NaT (validity-null OR an i64::MIN datum) falls through to the generic arm — the open-addressing shortcut only runs when
every value is a real timestamp.

Same-box best-of-3, 5M sparse Datetime64 ~5M distinct (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_hashops 5000000 unique dt`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | baseline (FxHashSet+Scalar) | patched (open-addr ns) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `unique` Datetime64 5M | 916.9ms | 158.1ms | 5.80x | 0.74x -> 4.07x (pandas 644.1ms) |

Bit-identical: new `unique_datetime64_open_addressing_and_nat_fallthrough` (no-NaT path == first-seen distinct ns
re-wrapped Datetime64; NaT datum proven to fall through and be DROPPED, not emitted) + fp-columnar 23 unique +
fp-frame 73 unique tests green. RESIDUAL: factorize Datetime64 (0.57x, 1167ms) still loses — its NaT handling depends
on use_na_sentinel (NaT → -1 or a first-seen bucket), so it needs an NaT-aware open-addressing variant, not the plain
no-NaT shortcut; that's the next follow-up. (nunique Datetime64 already wins ~1.2x via a different path.)

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — factorize Datetime64 reuses open-addressing ns map: 0.54x LOSS -> 1.2x WIN vs pandas (2.2x fp-side)
The last khash-floor follow-up (unique-Datetime64 entry's residual). factorize Datetime64 fell to FxHashMap + 5M
Datetime64 Scalar materialization (typed paths are `as_i64_slice` Int64-only). Added a Datetime64 branch: when
`!has_nulls()` AND the raw `as_datetime64_slice` ns has no NaT (`i64::MIN`), reuse `factorize_i64_wide(ns)` and
re-tag the unique ns `Scalar::Int64 → Scalar::Datetime64`. NaT-bearing columns fall through to the generic arm (its
NaT→-1 / first-seen-bucket logic is use_na_sentinel-dependent, not reproduced by the no-NaT shortcut).

Same-box back-to-back best-of (4 runs × best-of-6), 5M sparse Datetime64 (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_hashops
5000000 factorize dt`), `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | baseline (FxHashMap+Scalar) | patched (open-addr ns) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `factorize` Datetime64 5M | ~1210ms | ~550ms | 2.20x | 0.54x -> 1.20x (pandas 661.3ms) |

Bit-identical: new `factorize_datetime64_open_addressing_and_nat_fallthrough` (no-NaT codes+uniques exact; NaT datum
proven to fall through → coded -1 under use_na_sentinel, not a unique) + fp-columnar 10 factorize + fp-frame 12
factorize tests green. KHASH FLOOR CLOSED across Int64 AND Datetime64 for nunique/unique/factorize. RESIDUAL: uniques
output for high-card factorize is still `Vec<Scalar>` (the ~550ms vs Int64's 456ms gap = the 5M-unique re-tag pass);
a typed uniques column (from_datetime64_values/from_i64_values, bypassing the shared Scalar sort for sort=false) is the
remaining structural lever, shared by all factorize paths.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — duplicated(keep="first") wide-i64 open-addressing: 1.75x further fp-side (3.4x -> 6.0x vs pandas)
`duplicated` wide-i64 already avoided Scalar materialization (typed `&[i64]` + `duplicated_flags_typed`), so it won
2.6-3.4x — but its `FxHashSet<i64>` was still the residual on high-card wide keys. Added `duplicated_first_i64_wide`:
the open-addressing set, flagging `false` on first insert / `true` on repeat (default "first" policy only; last/none
keep FxHashSet). i64::MIN sentinel duplicate-state via a flag.

Same-box back-to-back best-of (4 × best-of-6), 5M sparse i64 ~5M distinct (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_hashops
5000000 duplicated wide`), `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | baseline (FxHashSet) | patched (open-addr) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `duplicated(first)` wide-i64 5M | ~147ms | ~84ms | 1.75x | 3.43x -> 6.00x (pandas 504.7ms) |

Bit-identical: new `duplicated_wide_i64_first_open_addressing_matches_reference` (flags vs HashSet-insert ref over
full-range pool incl. i64::MIN/MAX, 120 LCG trials) + fp-columnar 28 duplicated + fp-frame 37 duplicated/drop_duplicates
tests green. The open-addressing i64 table now serves nunique, unique, factorize, AND duplicated — confirming it as a
general replacement for FxHashSet/FxHashMap on high-cardinality wide-i64 keys (the khash floor). drop_duplicates (which
calls duplicated) inherits this win for free.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — factorize typed uniques output + raw-i64 sort: 1.27x further fp-side (wide 1.66x -> 2.18x vs pandas)
The last factorize residual: `uniques` was still a `Vec<Scalar>` (n × 32 B for high-card) on the typed paths, and the
shared sort compared `Scalar`s. Added `factorize_i64_typed(data, sort)` — dense-or-open-addr producing raw `Vec<i64>`
codes AND uniques, with the optional ascending sort remap done on raw i64 — and made the all-valid Int64 and no-NaT
Datetime64 cases RETURN EARLY, emitting uniques via `from_i64_values` / `from_datetime64_values` (no Scalar boxing on
input or output; the Scalar `uniques` Vec + Scalar sort are now reached only by Float/Bool/Utf8/NaT columns).

Same-box back-to-back best-of, 5M ~5M-distinct (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_hashops 5000000 factorize <mode>`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | Scalar uniques (prev) | typed uniques | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `factorize` wide-i64 5M | ~440ms | ~347ms | 1.27x | 1.72x -> 2.18x (pandas 756.6ms) |
| `factorize` Datetime64 5M | ~550ms | ~355ms | 1.55x | 1.20x -> 1.86x (pandas 661.3ms) |
| `factorize` dense-i64 5M | ~135ms | ~107ms | 1.26x | — |

Cumulative wide-i64 factorize this session: 1327ms (pre-open-addr) -> 347ms = 3.8x fp-side, 0.57x LOSS -> 2.18x WIN.
Bit-identical: the raw-i64 ascending sort equals `compare_scalars_na_last` for all-valid Int64/Datetime64 ns; the
existing `factorize_wide_i64_*` and `factorize_datetime64_*` differentials (BOTH sort modes vs O(n²)/reference) +
fp-columnar 10 factorize tests green. The wide-i64 hash frontier (nunique/unique/factorize/duplicated, Int64+Datetime64)
is now fully on typed open-addressing with typed I/O.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — mode wide/sparse Int64 open-addressing tally: 0.12x LOSS -> 1.23x WIN vs pandas (9.9x fp-side)
The WORST khash-floor gap found: `mode` had a dense histogram for bounded i64 but fell to `FxHashMap<Key, (count,
&Scalar)>` + Scalar materialization for SPARSE wide i64 — 8x SLOWER than pandas. Unlike value_counts, mode is
tally+argmax with a TINY output (just the most-frequent value(s)), so it is purely hash-bound — the open-addressing
lever applies cleanly. Added `mode_i64_wide`: open-addressing `i64 -> u32 count` over the raw `&[i64]`, then one pass
to find max-count + collect ascending winners. i64::MIN empty-sentinel counted separately.

Same-box best-of-3, 5M sparse i64 ~5M distinct (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_hashops 5000000 mode wide`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | baseline (FxHashMap+Scalar) | patched (open-addr) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `mode` wide-i64 5M | 2546.4ms | 258.1ms | 9.86x | 0.12x -> 1.23x (pandas 318.8ms) |

Biggest single flip of the session (8x loss → win). Bit-identical: new
`mode_wide_i64_open_addressing_matches_reference` (winners == HashMap max-count ref, ascending, over full-range pool
incl. i64::MIN/MAX with engineered ties, 150 LCG trials) + fp-columnar 5 mode + fp-frame 41 mode tests green. The
open-addressing i64 table now serves nunique/unique/factorize/duplicated/mode (Int64 + Datetime64 where applicable).
### 2026-06-28 BlackThrush - resample('s') sparse sub-daily run reducer: 0.97x -> 195x vs pandas (189x fp-side vs ORIG)
After the `resample('min')` label fix, the remaining sub-daily pathology was the sparse second-bin path: the 1M
minute-spaced fixture resampled to seconds spans ~60M possible bins, so the dense single-pass reducer bailed back to
`build_groups`. That fallback formatted and hashed one timestamp string per observed row, even though the data are
already ordered by bin and sub-daily semantics skip empty bins. Applied a guarded run reducer for sparse-but-bin-
monotone sub-daily inputs: accumulate sum/count for the current observed bin, flush a `Datetime64` bin-start label
when the bin changes, and fall back if bins ever decrease. This preserves row-order summation, skips empty second bins
as before, and avoids the String-key HashMap path entirely.

Same target dir `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-a`; ORIG is current `origin/main`
at `b3a4545e5`. ORIG `rch exec` fell open locally because no worker slot was admissible; patched `rch exec` ran on
worker `vmi1264463`. Command:
`rch exec -- cargo run -p fp-frame --example bench_resample --release -- 1000000 s mean`; pandas 2.2.3 comparator
uses the identical 1M minute-spaced timestamp fixture:
| workload | ORIG best | patched best | pandas best | ratio vs pandas | fp-side |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `resample('s').mean()` 1M | 4549.421ms | 24.042ms | 4684.060ms | 1.03x -> 194.83x | 189.23x |

Sibling `sum` sanity on the same patched tree: `resample('s').sum()` 1M best 13.961ms. Validation: focused
`series_resample_sparse_subdaily_typed_path_skips_empty_bins` release test green; conformance and valid per-crate
bench gates are recorded in the landing commit. The literal requested `cargo bench --release -p fp-frame` form remains
invalid Cargo syntax, so the valid per-crate bench command is `cargo bench -p fp-frame`.

### 2026-06-28 BlackThrush - resample('min') lazy Datetime64 affine output index: 1.14x vs ORIG
Follow-up on the same measured residual after the direct Datetime64 label keep. Current main still built a 1M-element
`Vec<IndexLabel::Datetime64>` for dense sub-daily output bins. Added a lazy `Datetime64` affine index backing sibling to
the existing lazy `Int64` affine backing and routed dense, no-empty-bin sub-daily resample output through it. Sparse-bin
sub-daily output keeps the explicit label path, so empty-bin skip semantics are unchanged.

Same target dir `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`; `rch exec` fell open locally for
the paired timing because workers were saturated, so the KEEP ratio uses clean `origin/main` and patched worktrees on the
same machine/target setup. ORIG is `b3a4545e5` (`perf(fp-frame): emit datetime labels for subdaily resample`). Command:

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — unique Float64 open-addressing (normalized-bits key, original-value output): 0.81x LOSS -> 2.97x WIN vs pandas (3.67x fp-side)
The open-addressing lever extended to Float64. `unique` had no float fast path → `FxHashSet<Key::FloatBits>` + 5M
Scalar materialization (0.81x vs pandas). Added `unique_f64_wide`: open-addressing set keyed by NORMALIZED float bits
(−0.0 → +0.0, as the generic Key does) while COLLECTING the original first-seen f64 — so a `-0.0`-first column keeps
`-0.0`. KEY TRICK: the empty sentinel `i64::MIN` IS the `-0.0` bit pattern, and no normalized key can equal it (−0.0
normalizes to +0.0 bits = 0), so the sentinel never collides with a real key. Gated on `as_f64_slice` (all-valid,
NaN-free → NaN columns fall through to the generic skip-NaN path).

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — mode Float64 open-addressing tally (normalized-bits key): 0.49x LOSS -> 2.28x WIN vs pandas (4.6x fp-side)
The float sibling of the mode-i64 win (and the unique-f64 residual). `mode` Float64 fell to FxHashMap<FloatBits,
(count,&Scalar)> + 5M Scalar materialization — 0.49x vs pandas. Added `mode_f64_wide`: open-addressing keyed by
NORMALIZED float bits (−0.0 == +0.0) with parallel u32 counts AND the first-seen original value (so a `-0.0`-mode
keeps `-0.0`), then argmax + ascending (`total_cmp`) winners. Empty sentinel `i64::MIN` (= −0.0 bits) never collides
with a normalized key. Gated on `as_f64_slice` (NaN-free; NaN columns fall through to the generic skip-NaN path).

### 2026-06-28 BlackThrush - value_counts wide Int64 typed outputs: 2.91x vs ORIG
Dig follow-up on the documented wide-Int64 `value_counts` residual after the open-addressing tally no-ship. The prior
ledger showed the tally itself was not hash-bound; the floor was sorting plus dual-column output. Added a narrow
all-valid Int64 path that keeps tally values as raw `i64`, emits the values column through `Column::from_i64_values`,
emits non-normalized counts through `Column::from_i64_values`, and skips count sorting when every count is tied. Null
and non-Int64 inputs keep the generic Scalar path, so pandas missing-bucket behavior is unchanged.

Same-worker proof on `hz2`, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cod-b`. ORIG is current
`origin/main` at `30745b5d` plus the benchmark-only `bench_hashops value_counts` arm; patched is this typed-output
path. Command:
`rch exec -- cargo run -p fp-columnar --example bench_hashops --release -- 5000000 value_counts wide`.

Validation: focused `fp-columnar --release value_counts` passed before the timing proof. After rebasing onto the
Float64 hash keeps now on main, the patched tree rechecked at 504.737670ms via the same command when `rch exec` fell
open locally. Final landing gates passed: `fp-conformance --release` green and valid per-crate
`cargo bench -p fp-columnar` green. The literal requested `cargo bench --release -p fp-columnar` form is still a Cargo
CLI error (`--release` is not accepted by `cargo bench`).

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — nlargest/nsmallest bounded top-k scan (Int64): 0.21x LOSS -> 2.14x WIN vs pandas (10.4x fp-side)
`Column::nlargest(k)` did a FULL `sort_values` (radix over all 5M) then took `[..k]` — O(n·passes) for a tiny k,
0.21x vs pandas' introselect. Added a bounded top-k LINEAR scan (`nkeep_typed_i64`): one sequential pass maintaining
the k best in a best-first buffer (binary insert; most elements rejected by the `worst` threshold), O(n) with a tiny
working set. Wired into `nlargest`/`nsmallest` (Int64, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4096, k < len — matching `sort_values`' STABLE
radix = value-order then first-seen) AND into `nkeep_impl` (the `_keep` variants, Int64+Float64, matching
`compare_scalars_na_last`). Two select_nth attempts (idx-indirection and tuple) were REVERTED as ~0-gain — select_nth
reorders the whole array; bounded-scan is the right algorithm for k ≪ n.

`-0.0` subtlety: `nlargest()` rides `sort_values`' radix (`total_cmp`, −0.0 < +0.0) so its fast path is Int64-ONLY;
`nkeep_impl`'s f64 path uses `partial_cmp` (−0.0 == +0.0) matching its own full-sort reference. Float64 `nlargest()`
(no-keep) stays on the radix sort (deferred — needs a total_cmp bounded scan).

Same-box best-of-3, 5M Int64, k=10 (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_nlargest`),

ref incl. ±0.0/±Inf) + fp-columnar 11 + fp-frame 31 nlargest/nsmallest tests green. GOTCHA: rch caches example
binaries by source hash — `touch` the example to force relink against a changed lib (3 stale-binary phantom reads
before this was caught).

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — nlargest/nsmallest Float64 bounded scan: REVERTED (fast ~8ms but NOT bit-identical to sort_values radix)
Follow-up to the i64 nlargest win: tried `nkeep_typed_f64_total` (bounded top-k scan keyed by `total_cmp` + position)
for `nlargest()`/`nsmallest()` Float64, reasoning total_cmp (−0.0 < +0.0, bit order) would match `sort_values`' typed
radix. MEASURED FAST (5M f64 k=10: 634ms -> ~8ms, ~79x), BUT the differential
`nlargest_nsmallest_i64_bounded_scan_matches_sort_take` (extended to f64 vs `sort_values(±)+take` over ±0.0/±Inf
data) FAILED at k=375: `total_cmp` order does NOT equal the typed Float64 radix permutation order for some
signed-zero/boundary case. Since `nlargest()` rides `sort_values` (radix), the fast path MUST reproduce that exact
order to be bit-identical — and total_cmp doesn't. REVERTED per the bit-identity rule (a fast-but-wrong path is not
shippable). NOTE: f64 `nlargest_keep(.,"first")` (the `_keep` variant via `nkeep_impl`, `partial_cmp`) is already
fast + bit-identical (different reference: `compare_scalars_na_last`, not radix) and stays landed. The remaining f64
`nlargest()` lever needs a bounded scan keyed by the EXACT float→sortable-bits transform `typed_radix_perm` uses, not
total_cmp — deferred. i64 nlargest/nsmallest (2.14x WIN) is unaffected and remains landed.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — nlargest/nsmallest Float64 bounded scan LANDED (partial_cmp, not total_cmp): 0.30x LOSS -> 31x WIN vs pandas (105x fp-side)
SUPERSEDES the revert note above. Root cause of the total_cmp differential failure: `sort_values`' f64 radix key
(`f64_radix_key`) CANONICALIZES ±0.0 → +0.0 (`if value == 0.0 { 0.0 }`) and the radix is stable — so its order is
`partial_cmp` (−0.0 == +0.0) + position-ascending, NOT total_cmp (which distinguishes −0.0 < +0.0). Wired
`nlargest()`/`nsmallest()` Float64 to the EXISTING `nkeep_typed_f64` (partial_cmp) bounded scan — bit-identical to
the radix.

Same-box best-of-3, 5M Float64 (∈[0,1)), k=10 (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_nlargest`),

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — Datetime64 sort/nlargest/mode CORRECTNESS FIX + bounded scan: 0.13x LOSS -> 3.1x WIN vs pandas (23x fp-side)
DISCOVERED a latent correctness bug: `compare_scalars_na_last` had no `Datetime64`/`Period` arm, and `Scalar::to_f64`
ERRORS for those dtypes — so the fallback `(to_f64, to_f64)` arm returned `Equal` for EVERY pair. Result: the generic
`sort_values`/`nlargest`/`nsmallest`/`mode` path on a Datetime64 (or Period) Column was a no-op that returned
POSITIONAL order, not value order (verified: `nlargest(2)` on `[30,10,20,40,5]` returned `[30,10]`, not `[40,30]`).
FIX: added exact `Datetime64 => a.cmp(b)` and `Period => ordinal.cmp` arms (mirroring the existing Timedelta64 arm).
This corrects datetime/period sort/nlargest/nsmallest/mode crate-wide to match pandas. Then wired the typed bounded
top-k scan (`nkeep_typed_i64` over the ns) into `nlargest`/`nsmallest` for no-NaT Datetime64.

Same-box best-of-3, 5M Datetime64, k=10 (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_nlargest`),

broken positional order), fp-frame sort/nlargest/nsmallest/mode 101 passed, nlargest differential extended to assert
Datetime64 nlargest/nsmallest == `sort_values±+take` (now exact) over date-spaced data. NOTE: this is a correctness
improvement (output CHANGES to value-order = pandas-correct), not bit-identical to the prior broken behavior — but no
test relied on the bug. Period columns gain correct ordering too (perf path Datetime-only for now).

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — Datetime64 sort_values radix path: REVERTED (1.24x fp-side but still 0.85x vs pandas, gather-bound)
After the Datetime64 comparator correctness fix, `Column::sort_values` on a Datetime64 column uses the generic
exact-comparator sort (526ms, 0.66x vs pandas 349ms). Tried a typed radix path (i64_radix_key over the ns +
`radix_argsort_u64`, gated no-NaT, re-wrap Datetime64) — bit-identical to the generic sort (differential
`datetime64_sort_values_matches_scalar_reference` green, both directions + ties + NaT→end). MEASURED 5M Datetime64:
526ms -> ~410ms = 1.24x fp-side, but still **0.85x vs pandas** (349ms). The residual is the cache-random
`reorder_by_positions` gather (5M random `data[perm[i]]`), exactly the documented "i64 sort radix REJECTED
(gather-bound, ~0-gain)" pattern — the radix removes the Scalar-comparison cost but the gather dominates and pandas'
C radix still wins. REVERTED the radix path per the don't-re-chase-rejected-levers discipline; KEPT the comparator
correctness fix and the differential test (it now guards the generic datetime sort). To actually beat pandas here
needs a faster gather (the rejected `reorder_by_positions` problem), not another radix.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — Column::sort_values direct VALUE radix (no gather): i64 2.4x, datetime 0.66x->1.86x WIN vs pandas
SUPERSEDES the datetime-sort-radix revert above. Insight: `Column::sort_values` returns only sorted VALUES (the row
permutation, when a caller needs it, comes from `argsort_with`), so it never needs the `data[perm[i]]` cache-random
GATHER that made the argsort path gather-bound. Replaced the i64 path's `radix_argsort + gather` with a direct value
radix (`radix_sort_i64_values`: 8-pass LSD over order-preserving keys in ping-pong buffers, sequential reads, no
gather), and re-added the Datetime64 no-NaT path on the same helper. Bit-identical: equal i64 values are
indistinguishable so tie order is irrelevant; descending = ascending reversed (ties identical). Float64 stays on
argsort+gather (its radix key canonicalizes ±0.0, so a value radix would corrupt −0.0 → +0.0 in the output).

datetime flips LOSS->WIN. i64 is a 2.4x fp-side improvement that removes the gather but still trails numpy's tuned
introsort core (78ms) for the values-only sort — a further radix-tuning (11-bit digits / high-zero-byte skip) could
close it. Benefits all 17 in-crate `Column::sort_values` callers (nlargest/unique fallbacks etc.). Validation: FULL

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — searchsorted_values typed i64 partition_point: 0.17x LOSS -> 0.90x near-parity vs pandas (5.4x fp-side)
`Column::searchsorted_values` ran a per-needle binary search that accessed `self.values[mid]` (Scalar) and called
`compare_scalars_na_last` per comparison — for 1M needles × ~23 steps that's ~23M Scalar-enum accesses (6x slower than
pandas' C binary search). Added a typed path: all-valid (sorted) Int64 self + all-Int64 needles run
`data.partition_point` over the raw `&[i64]` — `side="left"` → first `v >= needle` (`v < needle` partition),
`"right"` → first `v > needle` (`v <= needle` partition). Bit-identical to the generic binary search.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — searchsorted_values typed Datetime64 partition_point: 0.13x LOSS -> 0.68x vs pandas (5.2x fp-side)
Extends the i64 searchsorted typed path to Datetime64 (merge_asof / time-bucketing). Datetime64 searchsorted ran the
per-needle Scalar binary search (~196ms, 0.13x). Added: all-valid no-NaT sorted ns + all-(non-NaT)-Datetime64 needles
→ `partition_point` over the raw ns (the Datetime64 comparator is now exact, so bit-identical). NaT in self/needle
falls through (missing → generic handles).

5.2x fp-side, lifts the 7.6x catastrophe to ~1.5x-slower (the residual is the random `data[mid]` binary-search cache
pattern, same as the i64 case). NOTE: f64 searchsorted was measured and is NOT a gap — pandas float searchsorted with
random needles is slow (938ms) and fp's Scalar path already beats it, so f64 was left as-is. Bit-identical: new

fp `cum{sum,max,min}` had typed Float64 fast paths but i64 columns fell to the `nan*` Scalar path
(`nancumsum(&self.values)` materializes 5M Scalars from the lazy i64 column) — ~360ms, 0.06x vs pandas (15x slower).
Added typed i64 branches: read `as_i64_slice`, fold as f64 (`running += x as f64` etc.), emit Float64 — bit-identical

buffer), while pandas keeps Int64 (pure bandwidth) — closing fully needs an Int64-output cumsum (a dtype change vs
fp's current always-Float64 contract, separate from this perf fix). cumprod REVERTED: an i64 product overflows the

`Column::diff` was FULLY Scalar (no typed path) — for both i64 AND f64 it looped `self.values[i]`/`[i-abs]`,
materializing the lazy column → ~420ms, 0.05x vs pandas (18x slower). Added typed Float64-output paths: fill an f64
buffer (boundary slots NaN → missing via from_f64_values = the Scalar Null; body = a−b). i64 always safe ((x as f64)−(y
as f64) is finite). f64 gated all-finite (`as_f64_slice` is NaN-free, so all-finite ⇔ inf-free; finite−finite is never
NaN, only finite/overflow-inf which from_f64_values keeps; an inf input → inf−inf=NaN would diverge → falls back to
the Scalar path).

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — cum*/cumprod output via from_f64_values_owned (move, no realloc): cumsum 0.37x -> 0.66x vs pandas
Refinement of the cum* typed commit: the typed paths emitted via `from_f64_values` which does `Arc::from(Vec)` =
a cold realloc-copy (~5.7ms/1M ≈ 28ms at 5M). Switched the 7 cum{sum,prod,max,min} typed outputs to
`from_f64_values_owned`, which MOVES the Vec into the backing when NaN-free and falls back to `from_f64_values` (the
NaN→missing path) otherwise — bit-identical (NaN-free cum output is all-valid either way; NaN from f64 overflow routes

Cumulative cumsum i64 this session: 362ms -> 35ms = 10.3x fp-side, 0.06x -> 0.66x vs pandas (the residual is now just
the i64→f64 convert + the f64-vs-i64 output dtype). The f64 cum* paths inherit the same realloc savings. Bit-identical:
fp-columnar 15 cum tests green (incl. the NaN-bit-aware typed-vs-Scalar differential). NOTE: diff was left on
from_f64_values — its boundary NaN forces the _owned fallback anyway (a from_f64_values_owned_with_validity rewrite
could skip it; follow-up).

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — diff via from_f64_values_with_validity (move + nullable backing): 0.30x -> 0.82x vs pandas (near parity)
Follow-up to the diff typed commit: its outputs went through `from_f64_values` (NaN-at-boundary scan + Arc::from(Vec)
realloc-copy). Switched to `from_f64_values_with_validity(out, validity)`: fill an f64 body, mark the vacated boundary
as ONE invalid range (`ValidityMask::from_invalid_ranges`), and MOVE the Vec into a `LazyNullableFloat64` backing — no
NaN scan, no realloc. Bit-identical: that backing materializes a valid slot as `Float64(a−b)` and an invalid slot as
`Null(NaN)` = exactly the body + the Scalar path's `null_scalar` (`missing_for_dtype(Float64) = Null(NaN)`).

FALSE START (recorded): first tried `from_f64_values_owned_with_validity` — its backing is `lazy_all_valid_float64`
which IGNORES a partial validity mask, so boundary slots materialized as `Float64(0.0)` not missing; the two existing
`diff_periods_*` tests caught it (my typed-vs-typed differential false-passed). The right constructor is the
nullable-backed `from_f64_values_with_validity` (`all()` → all-valid fold, else `LazyNullableFloat64`).

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — shift (f64, missing fill) via from_f64_values_with_validity: 0.67x LOSS -> 2.1x WIN vs pandas
Applies the diff move-not-realloc lever to shift. The f64 missing-fill fast path filled vacated slots with NaN then
called `from_f64_values` (NaN scan + Arc::from realloc) — 64.9ms, 0.67x vs pandas. Switched to copy the surviving run
into an f64 body, mark the vacated slots as ONE invalid range, and MOVE into a `LazyNullableFloat64` backing
(`from_f64_values_with_validity`). Bit-identical: vacated → Null(NaN) (= the missing fill), copied body → Float64(src)
(as_f64_slice is NaN-free); handles abs≥len (all vacated).

0.19x vs pandas 64.4ms) — a typed path needs the fp-frame fill NullKind pinned (Int64 missing is Null(Null) vs the
f64 Null(NaN)); deferred to avoid a NullKind mismatch.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — pct_change typed i64/f64 (compute + explicit validity mask): 0.29x LOSS -> 5.7x WIN vs pandas (~20x fp-side)
`Column::pct_change` was fully Scalar (looped self.values[i], materializing the lazy column) — ~440ms, 0.29x vs
pandas. Added typed i64/f64 paths: compute (cur−prev)/prev into an f64 body and build an explicit ValidityMask
(invalid at the boundary AND where prev == 0.0 — the Scalar path's `p == 0.0` → Null guard; −0.0 == 0.0 covered), then
MOVE the body into a LazyNullableFloat64 backing via from_f64_values_with_validity. Bit-identical: invalid → Null(NaN)
(= Scalar Null), valid → Float64((c−p)/p) (finite or overflow ±inf, never NaN since prev ≠ 0).

KEY CORRECTION (recorded): from_f64_values does NOT mark a NaN missing — it KEEPS Float64(NaN) (a valid NaN slot),
which differs from the Scalar path's Null(NaN). The independent-oracle differential caught this (got=Float64(NaN),
exp=Null(NaN)); the fix is the validity-mask backing, which materializes invalid slots as Null(NaN). (Earlier diff/shift
already use from_f64_values_with_validity, so they were correct; this nails down WHY from_f64_values alone is wrong for
missing-bearing typed output.)

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — fillna nullable f64 (owned move) + typed nullable i64: f64 0.54x->1.20x WIN, i64 0.15x->0.56x
fillna's f64 typed path emitted via from_f64_values (Arc::from realloc); switched to from_f64_values_owned — its output
is all-valid + NaN-free (present non-NaN values or the finite fill) so the Vec MOVES. Nullable Int64 fillna had NO
typed path (as_i64_slice is all-valid-only → a column with nulls fell to the Scalar loop materializing the lazy
column); added `as_i64_slice_with_validity` + a typed path that fills each missing slot (validity bit alone, no NaN
sentinel) with the i64 fill into an all-valid i64 buffer. Bit-identical (present → data[i], missing → fv).

`Column::interpolate_linear` materialized the lazy column TWICE: input via `for v in &self.values { v.to_f64() }` into
Vec<Option<f64>>, output into Vec<Scalar> → Self::new — ~429ms, 0.69x vs pandas. Added a typed Float64 path: read
`as_f64_slice_with_validity`, mark present into an f64 buffer + a bool valid[], run the IDENTICAL interior-gap-fill +
trailing-forward-fill, then MOVE the buffer out with a validity mask (leading nulls stay missing) via
from_f64_values_with_validity. Bit-identical (filled/present → Float64(value), leading null → Null(NaN); same fill
arithmetic).

ffill/bfill were fully Scalar (looped self.values, cloning Scalars from the lazy column) — ~410-418ms, 0.08x vs
pandas. Added typed paths: carry last/next present value over the raw buffer + validity, a still-missing slot stays
missing via the validity mask. Bit-identical: a no-fill slot materializes the SAME null the Scalar path produced via
`v.clone()` — Float64 → Null(NaN), Int64 → Null(Null) (the bfill `Null(NaN)` init is dead, every slot is overwritten).

ffill flips LOSS->WIN. bfill is a 3.5-5x improvement but stays ~0.42x — its reverse iteration (`(0..len).rev()`) is

could recover it (follow-up). Bit-identical: new `ffill_bfill_typed_match_independent_oracle` (i64 & f64, random

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — from_f64_values_with_validity all-valid branch: MOVE not realloc — bfill f64 0.41x->1.18x WIN
ROOT-CAUSE refinement: `from_f64_values_with_validity`'s `validity.all()` branch returned `from_f64_values(data)`
(Arc::from realloc-copy). Changed it to `from_f64_values_owned(data)` (MOVES the Vec; falls back to from_f64_values on
any stray NaN → bit-identical). This is the constructor every recent typed missing-bearing op funnels through, so any
caller whose output happens to carry NO missing now skips the ~28ms (5M) realloc. The bfill bench (no trailing nulls →
fully back-filled → all-valid) was the visible victim: its 82ms was the realloc, NOT the reverse-iteration cache cost I
suspected.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — dropna typed f64+i64 (compact present values): 0.19x/0.30x LOSS -> 2.5x/2.3x WIN vs pandas
`Column::dropna` filtered self.values cloning Scalars from the lazy column (~285/176ms, 0.19x/0.30x vs pandas). Added
typed paths: compact present values from the raw buffer + validity into a typed Vec (f64: validity AND !is_nan; i64:
validity bit alone), then from_f64_values_owned / from_i64_values. Bit-identical to the order-preserving Scalar filter

(fillna/bfill i64) still Arc::from-realloc — but even moved they only reach ~parity (compute-bound vs pandas C), so the
owned-Int64 ScalarValues variant is NOT worth its structural cost; DEFERRED.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — replace typed Int64 scalar path: 0.14x LOSS -> 0.60x vs pandas (4.3x fp-side)
`Column::replace_values` materialized the lazy column + ran per-element `semantic_eq` over the target list + infer_dtype
— 272ms, 0.14x vs pandas. Added a typed Int64 path: all-valid Int64 column with all-Int64 (non-missing) targets AND
replacements → scan the raw &[i64] with integer equality (= semantic_eq for Int64), first-match-wins. Bit-identical

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — STRUCTURAL: owned-Int64 backing (LazyAllValidInt64Vec) — flips replace/fillna/bfill i64 to WINS
The previously-DEFERRED owned-Int64 ScalarValues variant, now LANDED (the directive's "different primitive" call was
right — and my earlier "parity not wins" estimate was wrong: the from_i64_values Arc::from realloc was ~40ms at 5M, not
~28ms). Added `LazyAllValidInt64Vec { data: Arc<Vec<i64>>, values }` (move-not-copy sibling of LazyAllValidInt64; no
dense_cycle cache — a downstream groupby just recomputes), `from_i64_values_owned`, and arms in
materialization/len/clone/as_i64_slice/as_i64_slice_with_validity. Rewired the all-valid-Int64-output ops to it:
from_i64_values_with_validity all() branch (→ ffill/bfill i64), replace/fillna/dropna i64.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — more i64-output ops on owned backing: astype f64->i64 0.42x->1.18x WIN; sort i64 1.26x fp-side
With LazyAllValidInt64Vec landed, switched three more all-valid-Int64-output sites from from_i64_values (Arc::from
~35-40ms/5M realloc) to from_i64_values_owned (move): astype Float64->Int64, sort_values i64 (radix value sort), and

`Column::between_inclusive` looped self.values (materializing the lazy column) + to_f64 + Vec<Scalar::Bool> + Self::new
— ~170ms, 0.10x vs pandas (10x slower). Added typed f64/i64 paths: compute the bound predicate over the raw buffer +
validity into a Vec<bool> (missing/NaN → false, matching the Scalar branch), then from_bool_values (all-valid Bool —
between never yields a null). Bit-identical (same predicate, x / x as f64).

result via from_f64_values / from_i64_values (Arc::from realloc-copy ~40ms/5M). Switched all 4 typed output sites
(f64 typed-input + f64 all-valid; i64 typed-input + i64 all-valid) to from_f64_values_owned / from_i64_values_owned
(MOVE). Bit-identical: i64 has no NaN (always moves); f64 owned falls back to from_f64_values on an op-produced NaN
(inf±inf), preserving the exact NaN->missing marking.

Near-parity (the residual is the 120MB read+write bandwidth, ~= pandas C) and benefits the WHOLE binary-arithmetic
family. Bit-identical: FULL fp-columnar suite 467 passed / 0 failed (updated vectorized_binary_all_valid_keeps_typed_

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — DataFrame scalar arithmetic (apply_scalar_op) owned-move: add_scalar 0.34x -> 1.02x vs pandas
The DataFrame add/sub/mul/div/pow/mod-scalar core `apply_scalar_op` had typed f64/i64 paths but emitted via
from_f64_values (Arc::from realloc — the exact cost BlackThrush's in-code note flagged as the dominant floor).
Switched both typed outputs to from_f64_values_owned (move; falls back on op-produced NaN → bit-identical).

Same-box best-of-3, 5M single-col DataFrame (`fp-frame/examples/bench_addscalar`),

| `df + scalar` f64 5M | 64.5ms | 21.5ms | 3.00x | 0.34x -> 1.02x (pandas 22.0ms) |

Flips LOSS->parity/WIN, covers the whole DataFrame scalar-arithmetic family. Bit-identical: fp-frame scalar/arithmetic
tests green. (NB: 3 PRE-EXISTING failures — series/dataframe arccosh+acosh golden mismatches — reproduce on a CLEAN
tree without this change; a peer's unrelated acosh golden drift, NOT caused by apply_scalar_op.)

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — abs/neg i64 owned-move output: 0.38x LOSS -> ~1.06x WIN vs pandas
abs/neg already had typed paths (f64 via the witness-carrying from_f64_all_valid_with_finite_opt), but the i64 arms
emitted via from_i64_values (Arc::from realloc). Switched to from_i64_values_owned (move; i64 wrapping_abs/wrapping_neg
output is all-valid). Bit-identical.

| `neg` i64 5M | 59.7ms | 20.7ms | 2.88x | 0.37x -> 1.05x (pandas 21.8ms) |

Both flip LOSS->WIN. Bit-identical: fp-columnar 26 abs/neg tests green. (f64 abs/neg already owned via the finiteness-
witness constructor; this closes their i64 siblings — the owned-Int64 backing now covers abs/neg/astype/sort/square/
replace/fillna/bfill/dropna i64.)

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — BLOCKER surfaced: fp-frame TEST BUILD broken by an in-progress Period refactor (conformance unrunnable)
While extending the owned-Int64 move-lever to the `Series.dt` accessors (year/month/day/dayofyear/weekofyear/hour/…/
dayofweek all route their all-valid i64 component output through `Column::from_i64_values` = Arc::from realloc), I found
`cargo build -p fp-frame --tests` FAILS to compile — a peer's incomplete `fp_types::Period` refactor (Period is now a
struct, not i64) left fp-frame test/ScalarKey code mismatched:
  crates/fp-frame/src/lib.rs:756/759/851 — `ScalarKey::Period(*v)` expected `Period`, found `i64` (enum field `Period(i64)` at :720)
The fp-frame LIB still compiles (examples link), and fp-columnar's own suite is green (467), but **no fp-frame test
can run**, so fp-frame conformance is currently unrunnable for everyone. NOT caused by my work — reproduces on a clean
checkout of origin/main.

CONSEQUENCE: I REVERTED my (bit-identical, lib-compiling) `Series.dt` owned-move change rather than ship an fp-frame
perf change I cannot validate against conformance. MEASURED while it was applied (5M, hourly datetimes): `dt.dayofweek`
48.7ms = 1.77x WIN vs pandas 86.2ms; `dt.year` 101ms (0.62x, pandas 62.5) and `dt.month` 121ms (0.50x, pandas 60.8)
IMPROVED by the realloc removal but remain LOSSES — they are calendar-civil-conversion compute-bound, not realloc-bound,
so owned alone won't flip them (a faster ns->civil algorithm is the real lever). RE-LAND the dt owned-move + pursue the
civil-conversion speedup once the peer's Period refactor restores the fp-frame test build.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — RE-LANDED: Series.dt component owned-move (peer Period refactor fixed → fp-frame tests run)
The fp-frame test build is restored (peer finished the Period refactor), so the deferred dt owned-move is re-landed and
VALIDATED. Switched the 5 typed_datetime_*_all_valid component outputs (year/dayofyear/weekofyear/civil[month,day]/
nanos[hour,min,sec,…,dayofweek]) from Column::from_i64_values (Arc::from realloc) to from_i64_values_owned (move).
Bit-identical (all-valid i64 component output).

Same-box best-of-3, 5M hourly datetimes (`fp-frame/examples/bench_dt2`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | before (Arc::from) | after (owned) | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |

| `dt.year` 5M | 110.1ms | 73.1ms | 1.51x | 0.57x -> 0.86x (pandas 62.5ms) |
| `dt.month` 5M | 126.4ms | 89.2ms | 1.42x | 0.48x -> 0.68x (pandas 60.8ms) |

dayofweek WIN; year/month improved 1.4-1.5x fp-side but remain LOSSES — calendar civil-conversion (ns->y/m/d) is the
bottleneck, not the realloc (the next lever is a faster ns->civil algorithm, e.g. Howard Hinnant's days_from_civil
inverse). Bit-identical: fp-frame 17 dt component tests green (fp-frame test build now compiles).

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — Series.dt year/month/day PARALLEL civil-conversion: 0.5-0.86x LOSS -> 3.5-4.2x WIN vs pandas
The remaining dt losses (year 0.86x, month 0.68x) were CIVIL-CONVERSION COMPUTE-bound (Hinnant's ns->y/m/d is already
the optimal serial algorithm; ~12 int ops/elem, the loads hide behind the math), NOT realloc-bound. Since it's
compute-bound (not bandwidth-bound — the regime where memory's "thread-spawn HURTS" note applies), added a scoped-thread
parallel mapper `par_map_i64_from_nanos` (available_parallelism().min(8), n>=200k gate, serial fallback) and routed the
year + civil[month,day] paths through it. Bit-identical (chunk i writes out[i*chunk..]; order preserved).

Same-box best-of-3, 5M hourly datetimes (`fp-frame/examples/bench_dt2`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:

| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `dt.year` 5M | 73.1ms | 14.96ms | 0.86x -> 4.18x (pandas 62.5ms) |
| `dt.month` 5M | 89.2ms | 17.36ms | 0.68x -> 3.50x (pandas 60.8ms) |

Both flip LOSS->strong WIN (~5x core scaling). Confirms the compute-bound-parallelism regime is DISTINCT from the
bandwidth-bound ops (add/abs) where threads only contend. NEXT: the nanos-component (dayofweek/hour/min/sec) and
dayofyear/weekofyear paths are also compute-bound and would win more via the same helper (they already win via owned;
dayofweek 2.70x). Bit-identical: fp-frame 17 dt component tests green.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — PARALLEL transcendental unary math (exp/log/sin/cos/…): ~1.0x parity -> 3.4-4.5x WIN vs pandas
Extends the compute-bound-parallelism lever (from dt civil-conversion) to the libm transcendental unary ops. They were
already ~parity serially (scalar libm == numpy's default scalar libm: exp 1.02x, sin 1.08x), but each f(x) is ~10-30ns
of COMPUTE (the load hides behind the math), so chunked scoped threads scale near-linearly. Added `typed_float_unary_par`
+ free `par_map_vec_f64` (available_parallelism().min(8), n>=200k gate, serial fallback) and routed 18 transcendentals
through it (exp/log10/log2/sin/cos/tan/asin/acos/atan/sinh/cosh/tanh/asinh/acosh/atanh/exp_m1/ln_1p/cbrt). The CHEAP
maps (reciprocal/to_degrees/to_radians/round) stay on the serial `typed_float_unary` (bandwidth-bound — threads would
only contend). Bit-identical (same f, order-preserving chunks, same from_f64_values_owned).

Same-box best-of-3, 5M f64 (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_trig`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | serial | parallel | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |

| `sin` 5M | 55.2ms | 13.3ms | 1.08x -> 4.50x (pandas 59.7ms) |

(All 18 transcendentals get the same ~3-5x core scaling.) NOTE: `log`/`log1p` use the NULLABLE unary helper
(typed_float_unary_nullable_owned, ln of negatives → NaN→missing) which isn't parallelized yet — a parallel nullable
variant (per-chunk validity) is the follow-up; they're at ~0.95x parity so lower priority. FULL fp-columnar suite 467
passed / 0 failed.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — PARALLEL nullable transcendentals (sqrt/ln): 0.89-0.95x -> 2.0-3.2x WIN vs pandas
Completes the transcendental-parallelism follow-up: the 2 nullable-unary callers (sqrt, ln — may yield NaN→missing for
negative inputs). Added `typed_float_unary_nullable_owned_par` that runs the expensive f(x) in parallel via the existing
`par_map_vec_f64`, then does ONE cheap serial validity/finiteness scan over the result (the f(x) is the cost, the
validity bookkeeping is bandwidth). Bit-identical to the serial nullable helper (same f, same NaN→invalid rule, witness).

Same-box best-of-3, 5M f64 (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_trig`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | serial | parallel | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `sqrt` 5M | 28.2ms | 12.3ms | 0.89x -> 2.05x (pandas 25.2ms) |
| `ln` 5M | 43.0ms | 12.8ms | 0.95x -> 3.19x (pandas 40.8ms) |

Both flip to WIN. With this, the entire unary-math transcendental surface (exp/log/log2/log10/ln/sqrt/sin/cos/tan/asin/
acos/atan/sinh/cosh/tanh/asinh/acosh/atanh/exp_m1/ln_1p/cbrt) is parallelized and wins 2-4.5x; cheap maps
(reciprocal/to_degrees/to_radians/round) remain serial (bandwidth-bound). FULL fp-columnar suite 467 passed / 0 failed.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — PARALLEL libm binaries (pow/atan2/hypot): -> 4.4-10.3x WIN vs pandas
Extends compute-bound parallelism to the libm BINARY ops. pow (ArithmeticOp::Pow) flows through
try_vectorized_binary's f64 arm — special-cased Pow there to par_map_vec_f64 (add/sub/mul/div/mod stay serial,
bandwidth-bound). atan2/hypot (separate Column methods) went through typed_float_binary (which also did an
all_valid_as_f64 COPY + from_f64_values realloc); added typed_float_binary_par (reads both f64 slices directly — no
copy — parallel compute, owned move) and routed them. Bit-identical (same f, order preserved, NaN→Float64(NaN) via
owned fallback).

Same-box best-of-3, 5M f64 (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_pow`, `bench_atan2`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | serial | parallel | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `pow` (col**col) 5M | 70.3ms | 15.9ms | 4.42x | 1.00x -> 4.43x (pandas 70.5ms) |
| `atan2` 5M | 173.4ms | 23.0ms | 7.54x | 1.18x -> 8.87x (pandas 204.0ms) |
| `hypot` 5M | 132.6ms | 14.9ms | 8.90x | 1.16x -> 10.34x (pandas 154.2ms) |

All strong WINS. (pandas arctan2/hypot are themselves slow ~150-200ms; fp already edged them serially, now dominates.)
Cheap binaries (add/sub/mul/div/mod/max/min/copysign) stay serial — bandwidth-bound. FULL fp-columnar suite 467
passed / 0 failed.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — PARALLEL remaining dt components (hour/dayofyear/weekofyear/is_leap_year/is_month_start/…): 4.4-7.9x WIN
Completes the dt-accessor parallelism: routed the nanos-component (hour/minute/second/dayofweek), dayofyear,
weekofyear, and the BOOL calendar predicates (is_leap_year/is_month_start/is_quarter_start/…) through the parallel
mappers (par_map_i64_from_nanos + new par_map_bool_from_nanos), with a NaT pre-scan + serial/small-n fallback.
Bit-identical (same per-element civil math, order-preserving chunks; from_i64_values_owned / from_bool_values output).

Same-box best-of-3, 5M hourly datetimes (`fp-frame/examples/bench_dt3`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | parallel | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |

| `dt.is_leap_year` 5M | 15.00ms | 7.87x (pandas 118.1ms) |
| `dt.is_month_start` 5M | 13.56ms | 4.47x (pandas 60.6ms) |

All strong WINS (~5x core scaling over the serial civil path). The ENTIRE dt-accessor surface (year/month/day/
dayofweek/dayofyear/weekofyear/hour/minute/second/is_leap_year/is_month_start/…) is now parallel + wins 4-8x.
Bit-identical: fp-frame 55+ dt tests green.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — skew/kurt typed moment path: 2.4-2.5x -> 3.1-3.3x WIN vs pandas
skew/kurt called nanskew/nankurt over &self.values (collect_finite materializes the lazy column to Scalars). Added a
typed path (`typed_collect_finite_f64`: drop NaN / keep ±inf for Float64, all values for Int64 — straight off the
buffer) + VERBATIM nanskew/nankurt moment math. Bit-identical (same nums Vec, same serial-sum order, same formula).

Same-box best-of-3, 5M f64 (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_skew`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | baseline (Scalar) | typed | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `skew` 5M | 45.6ms | 34.5ms | 1.32x | 2.51x -> 3.31x (pandas 114.3ms) |
| `kurt` 5M | 45.9ms | 35.1ms | 1.31x | 2.36x -> 3.09x (pandas 108.3ms) |

Modest fp-side (the powi(2)/(3)/(4) moment passes are also compute) but already-win -> bigger-win, bit-identical.
NOTE: parallelizing the moment SUMS would break bit-identity (nanskew's serial left-fold vs a tree reduction round
differently), so the typed-serial path is the bit-identical ceiling here. (Other reductions sum/mean/std already win
1.2-8x.) FULL fp-columnar suite 467 passed / 0 failed.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — str op parallelism: ~0-gain (overhead-bound, NOT compute-bound) — REVERTED
Tried extending the compute-bound-parallelism lever to the contiguous-Utf8 str ops (str.len / str.contains / is*
predicates) via a scoped-thread `par_map_str_windows` over the offset-windows. MEASURED ~0-gain and REVERTED.

Same-box best-of-3, 2M short strings ("Hello_World_<n>", ~15 chars):
| op | serial | parallel | fp-side |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `str.contains` 2M | 46.8ms | 43.7ms | 1.07x |
| `str.len` 2M | 25.5ms | 25.3ms | 1.01x |

CAUSE: for TYPICAL short strings the per-string work (a few-byte substring scan / char count) is tiny; the cost is the
per-row `from_utf8` validation + offset indexing + output Vec build, which is overhead/bandwidth-bound — so the loop is
NOT compute-bound and threads don't help (cf. dt civil-conversion / libm transcendentals, which ARE ~12-30ns/elem
compute and scale 3-10x). REGIME BOUNDARY: compute-bound parallelism pays only when per-element work >> the per-element
memory/overhead; short-string ops fall on the wrong side. (Very long strings could differ, but str.* already WINS
8-12x vs pandas' object-dtype loop, so this is not a gap.) Don't re-attempt str-op parallelism for short strings.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — PARALLEL f64 mod (a%b): 1.57x -> 6.14x WIN vs pandas
Added ArithmeticOp::Mod to the try_vectorized_binary f64 parallel special-case (alongside Pow). `python_mod_f64`
(NaN/inf branches + fmod, ~8ns/elem) is COMPUTE-bound — parallelizing it scaled 3.9x (my "bandwidth floor ~25ms"
estimate was WRONG: the compute dominated and the output write didn't bottleneck). add/sub/mul/div stay serial
(bandwidth-bound, ~parity-win already). Bit-identical (same python_mod_f64, order preserved).

Same-box best-of-3, 5M f64 (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_mod`),

(div checked too: 25.8ms = 1.08x WIN already, bandwidth-bound — left serial, NOT parallelized.) FULL fp-columnar
suite 467 passed / 0 failed.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — PARALLEL f64 floordiv (a//b): 2.34x -> 4.85x WIN vs pandas
Added ArithmeticOp::FloorDiv to the try_vectorized_binary f64 parallel special-case (with Pow/Mod). python_floordiv
(branches + floor + fdiv, ~7ns/elem) is compute-bound. Bit-identical.

Same-box best-of-3, 5M f64 (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_fdiv`),

| `floordiv` (a//b) f64 5M | 35.0ms | 16.9ms | 2.07x | 2.34x -> 4.85x (pandas 82.0ms) |

(Lower scaling than mod's 3.9x — floordiv is lighter compute so more bandwidth-relative, but still a clear win.) The
f64 binary parallel special-case now covers Pow/Mod/FloorDiv (compute-bound); add/sub/mul/div stay serial (bandwidth).
FULL fp-columnar suite 467 passed / 0 failed.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — PARALLEL i64 mod/floordiv: 0.63-0.88x LOSS -> 3.0x WIN vs pandas
i64 mod/floordiv go through vectorized_binary_i64 (not the f64 apply path). python_mod_i64 / python_floor_div_i64
(integer idiv ~20-40 cycles + sign adjustment) are COMPUTE-bound and were LOSSES. Added par_map_vec_i64 and
parallelized the Mod/FloorDiv out-map (combined-validity gate preserved; add/sub/mul stay serial). Bit-identical.

Same-box best-of-3, 5M i64 (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_imod`),
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankenpandas-cc`:
| op | serial | parallel | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `mod` (a%b) i64 5M | 37.6ms | 10.86ms | 3.46x | 0.88x -> 3.04x (pandas 33.0ms) |
| `floordiv` (a//b) i64 5M | 51.3ms | 10.65ms | 4.82x | 0.63x -> 3.01x (pandas 32.1ms) |

Both flip LOSS->WIN — integer idiv is genuinely compute-bound (unlike pipelined fdiv/add). The mod/floordiv family
(f64 AND i64) is now parallel + wins 3-6x. FULL fp-columnar suite 467 passed / 0 failed.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — PARALLEL scalar pow/mod (df ** s, df % s): 1.01x/2.47x -> 4.5x/7.6x WIN
apply_scalar_op spreads COLUMNS across par_map_columns workers but is SERIAL within each column — so a single-column
Series ** scalar (the common case) left 7 cores idle on the compute-bound powf. Added an opt-in compute_bound path
(apply_scalar_op_inner) that parallelizes WITHIN each column (par_map_f64_buf) when there are <=2 columns (so outer×inner
thread nesting stays <=16; >2 columns already saturate par_map_columns). pow_scalar/mod_scalar opt in. Bit-identical.

Same-box best-of-3, 5M f64 single-col DataFrame (`fp-frame/examples/bench_powscalar`),

| `df % 3.0` 5M | 28.2ms | 9.20ms | 3.07x | 2.47x -> 7.59x (pandas 69.8ms) |

This resolves BlackThrush's 2026-06-20 note ("threading apply_scalar_op was ~0-gain") — that was for CHEAP ops
(add/neg, bandwidth-bound); pow/mod are COMPUTE-bound so within-column parallelism pays. add/sub/mul/div keep the
serial wrapper. fp-frame 14 scalar-arith + 8 pow/mod tests green.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — typed_float_binary slice-direct + owned: maximum/minimum/copysign 0.62x LOSS -> 2.79x WIN
`typed_float_binary` (element-wise maximum/minimum/copysign/fmax) called `all_valid_as_f64()` on BOTH operands — each a
full to_vec COPY (2×40MB at 5M) — then `from_f64_values` (Arc::from realloc). For these CHEAP ops (1 cmp / copysign)
the two copies + realloc dominated, making them LOSSES. Rewrote to read both f64 buffers DIRECTLY (no copy) when typed
and MOVE the result (from_f64_values_owned); i64/mixed inputs keep the converting path. Bit-identical (same f, order).

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — where/mask select owned-move: 0.83x LOSS -> 2.13x WIN vs pandas
where_cond_series / mask_series / where_cond(scalar) typed select paths emitted via from_f64_values / from_i64_values
(Arc::from realloc). The output is an all-valid select of two all-valid (NaN-free) buffers, so switched to
from_*_values_owned (MOVE). Bit-identical (cond[i] ? s[i] : o[i], no NaN introduced).

Same-box best-of-3, 5M f64 (`fp-columnar/examples/bench_cmpwhere where`),

Flips LOSS->WIN; also covers mask_series + where_cond(scalar). NOTE (separate, harder): element-wise comparison `a<b`
is 8.3ms vs pandas' 3.3ms (0.40x) — already typed/hoisted/owned, the residual is LLVM autovectorization of
f64-compare→Vec<bool> vs numpy's hand-tuned SIMD mask (a safe-Rust SIMD ceiling; std::simd/intrinsics would be the
lever, deferred). FULL fp-columnar suite 467 passed / 0 failed.

### 2026-06-27 TealOsprey — SIMD f64 comparison (a<b): ~0-gain — REVERTED
Tried the "different primitive" lever for the a<b SIMD ceiling: added `#![feature(portable_simd)]` to fp-columnar
(safe — no unsafe) and rewrote binary_comparison's f64 path with 8-wide f64x8 simd_lt/gt/eq/… + Mask::to_array →
copy_from_slice. MEASURED ~0-gain (5M a<b: 8.3ms → 8.0ms, 1.04x) and REVERTED.

CAUSE: the bottleneck is NOT the f64 compare loop (which the scalar version already autovectorizes adequately) — it's
the bool-mask → byte output. `Mask::to_array()` unpacks the SIMD mask register to 8 bytes per chunk, which costs about
what the scalar bool store did, so the explicit SIMD compare buys nothing. fp a<b stays 8.3ms vs pandas' 3.3ms (0.40x).
The residual ~2.5x bandwidth gap is in the Vec<bool> output path (vec![false;n] zeroing + per-elem byte writes +
from_bool_values), not the comparison — a packed-bitmask Bool representation (1 bit/elem instead of 1 byte) would be
the real lever, but that's a structural Bool-column change (every Bool consumer), DEFERRED. portable_simd Mask→bytes is
NOT the answer for this op.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — Series f64 select/clip owned-move output: where/mask 0.68-0.70x LOSS -> 1.66-1.69x WIN
The Series-level typed fast paths `where_cond_series` / `mask_series` / `clip_with_series` (and `update`) each had an
i64 branch emitting `from_i64_values_owned` (MOVE) but the *f64* sibling still emitted `from_f64_values` (Arc::from(Vec)
cold-realloc-copy of the freshly-built output Vec — ~40MB extra traffic at 5M). When the i64 paths were converted to
owned-move (TealOsprey 2026-06-27), the f64 siblings at these 4 Series-level call sites were MISSED — visible as the
f64 op running ~3x slower than its i64 twin in `bench_survey2`. Switched all four to `from_f64_values_owned` (MOVE).
Bit-identical: every output is provably NaN-free (both operands gated through `as_f64_slice` = all-valid no-NaN;
max/min and bit-select of NaN-free f64 cannot introduce NaN), and `from_f64_values_owned` re-scans for NaN and falls
back to the copy constructor if any were present — so the result column is semantically identical.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — expanding sum/mean + SeriesGroupBy transform owned-move: transform 0.54x LOSS -> 1.18x WIN
Same missed-sibling owned-move lever as the where/mask/clip fix above, three more full-length all-valid f64 producers
that still emitted `from_f64_values` (Arc::from(Vec) cold-realloc-copy of the freshly-built output Vec, ~40MB at 5M):
`running_sum` (the expanding().sum()/mean() typed fast path) and BOTH SeriesGroupBy.transform fast paths (bounded-Int64
key + contiguous-Utf8 key, the sum/mean broadcast). Each builds a fresh full-length Vec<f64> then copied it; switched
to `from_f64_values_owned` (MOVE). Bit-identical: expanding values are finite acc/acc-over-count of all-valid no-NaN
input (min_periods<=1 ⇒ no below-min NaN); transform broadcasts finite group sums/means; and from_f64_values_owned
re-scans for NaN + falls back to the copy path if any slipped through.

SeriesGroupBy transform mean/sum flip LOSS->WIN; expanding sum/mean go near-parity->2.2x WIN. The remaining ~17

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — dt.total_seconds() owned-move output: 0.72x LOSS -> 1.88x WIN
Same owned-move lever, the Timedelta64 `dt.total_seconds()` typed fast path: it built a full-length `Vec<f64>`
(`nanos / 1e9`, always finite — the existing comment already proves no-NaN) then emitted it via `from_f64_values`
(Arc::from(Vec) cold-realloc-copy, ~40MB at 5M). For this trivial-compute op (one divide/elem) the copy DOMINATES
(sister to the `abs` 0.35x arc-copy floor). Switched to `from_f64_values_owned` (MOVE). Bit-identical: i64-nanos/1e9
is finite ⇒ owned never hits its NaN fallback; NaT rows still route to the Scalar path (gated by `!contains(NAT)`).

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — Utf8 factorize typed Scalar-backed path: 0.47x LOSS -> 4.9x WIN (10.6x fp-side)
factorize() on an all-valid Utf8 Series whose column is Scalar-materialized (the `from_values(Vec<Scalar::Utf8>)`
ingestion path — NOT `LazyContiguousUtf8`, so the cached-witness and byte-span fast paths can't fire) fell to the
generic ScalarKey path: it boxed every code as `Scalar::Int64` (2M × 32B), re-inferred the codes' dtype through
`from_values`, and materialized a `(0..n)` `Vec<IndexLabel>` for the codes index (then re-scanned it for uniqueness in
`Index::new`). Added a typed all-valid-Utf8 path BEFORE the generic one: key on the borrowed `&str` via
`FxHashMap<&str,i64>`, emit codes through `from_i64_values_owned` + the O(1) lazy unit-range index (sibling of the
Int64 factorize paths), clone each unique once. Bit-identical: first-seen code assignment + uniques order match the
ScalarKey path for all-valid Utf8 (factorize suite green). Also switched the two CONTIGUOUS Utf8 paths (cached-witness +
byte-span) from `Index::new((0..n) labels)` to the same lazy unit-range index — same lever, removes a ~32MB IndexLabel
build per call even though the factorize witness itself is OnceCell-cached.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — Utf8 duplicated() typed Scalar-backed path: 0.24x LOSS -> 1.18-2.12x WIN
Sister to the Utf8 factorize fix: `duplicated()` on an all-valid Utf8 Series with a Scalar-materialized column
(from_values ingestion, not LazyContiguousUtf8 ⇒ the byte-span dup-flags path can't fire) fell to the generic
ScalarKey path, which wraps each value in a ScalarKey AND boxes the entire 2M-element output as `Scalar::Bool` then
rebuilds the column via `with_values_preserving_index` (from_values). Added a typed all-valid-Utf8 path: key on the
borrowed `&str` via `FxHashMap<&str,()>`, write a typed `Vec<bool>` mask, emit through `bool_mask_preserving_name`.
Bit-identical: first occurrence unflagged, rest flagged on the same string keys; all-valid ⇒ no Null bucket.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy.count() dense path generalized to any all-valid value dtype: 0.60x LOSS -> 12.5x WIN
The dense direct-address count fast path (bounded-Int64 key ⇒ gid_of[k-min], tally sizes, no SipHash build_groups)
gated its VALUE column on `as_f64_slice() || as_i64_slice()` — i.e. only fired for numeric values. A Utf8 (or Bool/
Datetime) value column, even all-valid, fell to the generic SipHash build_groups path (pointer-key, 2 cache misses/row).
But count() never reads the value data — for an all-valid column every row counts, so count == group size regardless of
dtype. Generalized the gate to `!self.series.column.has_any_missing()` (both the Int64-key and the contiguous-Utf8-key
dense blocks). Bit-identical: numeric all-valid still hits dense (unchanged), numeric-with-NaN still falls through
(has_any_missing true, excluded rows), and non-numeric all-valid now hits dense with the same first-seen key order /
size output the build_groups path produced.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — groupby-by-Scalar-backed-Utf8-key reductions dense path: 0.52x LOSS -> 2.4-3.7x WIN
Grouping a numeric value BY a Scalar-materialized Utf8 key (`from_values` key, NOT LazyContiguousUtf8) made every
reduction fall to the slow generic SipHash `build_groups` path. The dense reduction folds (`dense_group_fold` for
sum/mean/max/min, `dense_group_var_std` for var/std) ALREADY obtained a dense gid layout from `dense_group_ids` (which
handles Scalar-backed Utf8) but then BAILED on `ki.is_none() && ku.is_none()` because their inline label construction
only knew Int64 (`as_i64_slice`) and contiguous-Utf8 (`as_utf8_contiguous`) keys. Added a shared `dense_group_labels`
helper that builds first-seen group labels for all three key kinds dense_group_ids supports (Int64 / contiguous-Utf8 /
Scalar-backed-Utf8) and routed both folds through it, dropping the bail. Bit-identical: same gids, same first-seen
label order, same value-order folds; the only change is that a Scalar-backed Utf8 key now produces labels instead of
returning None.

Same-box best-of-6, 2M f64 value grouped by Scalar-backed Utf8 key, pandas 2.2.3 rebuilding the groupby per call

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy.count() by Scalar-backed Utf8 key dense path: 0.62x LOSS -> 3.15x WIN
Follow-up to the reductions fix: count()'s two dense blocks gate the KEY on `as_i64_slice` / `as_utf8_contiguous`, so a
Scalar-backed Utf8 key (from_values) still fell to the SipHash build_groups path. Added a third block before the generic
fallback driven by `dense_group_ids` + the new `dense_group_labels` helper: all-valid value ⇒ every row counts ⇒ a
group's count is its size, tallied in one pass over the gids. Bit-identical (same first-seen order/labels; size ==
non-missing count for an all-valid column).

first()/last() ALWAYS called the SipHash `build_groups` — no dense path at all, even for Int64 keys. For an all-valid
typed value column, first()/last() of each group is simply the value at the group's first-seen / last-seen row. Added a
dense path (gated on `as_f64_slice`/`as_i64_slice` value + `dense_group_ids` + `dense_group_labels`): record first_row
(resp. last_row) per gid in one pass, gather, emit typed. Covers Int64 / contiguous-Utf8 / Scalar-backed-Utf8 keys.
Bit-identical: all-valid ⇒ first/last row == first/last non-missing; first-seen gid order == build_groups order.

f64 value and/or a Scalar-backed Utf8 key fell to the generic `agg_values_scalar` build_groups path. Added a dense
per-group distinct-count over any dense gid layout (dense_group_ids + dense_group_labels): per-gid FxHashSet of
canonical f64 bits (or raw i64), counted in one pass (mirror of the dense `unique()` f64 path). Bit-identical: distinct

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — DataFrameGroupBy by Scalar-backed Utf8 key: materialize-to-contiguous: 0.24x LOSS -> parity/WIN
`df.groupby("strcol").agg()` — the most common groupby idiom — fell to the SipHash build_groups path when the key was a
Scalar-materialized Utf8 column (from_values), because every dense bypass in `aggregate_named_func` / `try_count_dense`
gates the single Utf8 key on `as_utf8_contiguous()`. Added a fallback in `aggregate_named_func`: when the lone key is an
all-valid NON-contiguous Utf8 column and every value column is dense f64/i64, materialize the key to an owned contiguous
(bytes, offsets) buffer ONCE via the new `utf8_key_owned_contiguous` helper (O(key bytes), far cheaper than
build_groups' Vec<ScalarKey> + SipHash map + wrapper sort) and reuse the identical `aggregate_str_dense` contiguous path.
Covers sum/mean/std/var/min/max/first/last/prod/median/count (count falls through to aggregate_named_func). Bit-identical:
same byte spans ⇒ same first-seen gids, lexicographic key order, per-group row-order folds.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — string-groupby u128 inline-key pack for 9..=16-byte keys: ~10-20% high-card gain
Follow-up on the high-card string-groupby floor: `aggregate_str_dense`'s low-cardinality hash-group had a `u64` pack
fast path (inline-key FxHashMap) only for keys ≤8 bytes; wider fixed-width keys (e.g. `group_key_00042`, 15B) fell to
`FxHashMap<&[u8]>`, which re-hashes the cache-cold byte span on every probe and byte-compares on collision. Added a
`u128` pack path for fixed-width 9..=16-byte keys (`pack_utf8_span_u128` + `fixed_width_utf8_spans_le16`): the pack is
bijective for a fixed width, so grouping by the packed value is identical to grouping by the span. Bit-identical.

A modest, bit-identical high-card gain (neutral at low card) that generalizes to all fixed-width ≤16-byte string keys.

ANY Utf8 key (contiguous OR Scalar-backed) fell to build_groups + a scattered per-group `col.values()[idx]` Scalar
gather. Added a single all-valid Utf8 key branch: hash-group the borrowed &str (via pivot_utf8_key_strs, covers both
backings), sort distinct keys when self.sort, then run the existing typed-f64 argmax/argmin scan over `as_f64_slice`
value columns. Bit-identical: same sorted (str::cmp) group order and first-extreme-row-in-row-order index as the generic
path; all-valid f64 value gate ⇒ no missing to skip.

| op | before | after | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `df.groupby(Utf8).idxmax()` 2M card=1000 | 191.3ms | 30.5ms  | 6.27x | 0.46x -> 2.88x (pandas 87.8ms) |
| `df.groupby(Utf8).idxmax()` 2M card=100k | 797.0ms | 154.5ms | 5.16x | 0.38x -> 1.95x (pandas 302.8ms) |

Flips LOSS->WIN (idxmin shares the path). Also confirmed this turn: DataFrameGroupBy nunique (2.3x WIN), pivot_table by
Utf8 (4.5-5.4x WIN), Series.map(dict) Utf8 (1.3-1.7x WIN) all already dominate — no gap. FULL fp-frame suite 3109/0.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — DataFrameGroupBy first/last/all/any by Scalar-backed Utf8 key: 0.31x LOSS -> 2.6-3.5x WIN
The remaining i64-key-only single-key dense bypasses — `try_bool_reduce_dense` (all/any) and `try_first_last_dense`
(first/last; its inline Utf8 branch handled only the CONTIGUOUS backing) — sent a Scalar-backed Utf8 key
(`from_values`, common with a mixed/Bool value column that also disqualifies the aggregate_named_func materialization
gate) to the SipHash build_groups + scattered Scalar-gather path. Added a shared `single_utf8_key_dense_grouping`
helper (Utf8 analog of int64_dense_grouping: first-seen gids over the borrowed &str via pivot_utf8_key_strs, str::cmp
sort when self.sort, by-named output index) and routed all/any + first/last (+ the count contiguous block, dedup)
through it. Bit-identical: same sorted group order + value-type-agnostic chosen-row/fold as the generic path.

Same-box best-of-6, 2M rows × (f64 + Bool) value cols by Scalar-backed Utf8 key (`bench_dfgbu3`), pandas 2.2.3 per-call:
| op | before | after | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `df.groupby(Utf8).last()` 2M card=100k | 721.2ms | 84.9ms  | 8.49x | 0.31x -> 2.64x (pandas 224.2ms) |
| `df.groupby(Utf8).any()`  2M card=100k | 678.0ms | 92.6ms  | 7.32x | 0.42x -> 3.09x (pandas 286.4ms) |
| `df.groupby(Utf8).all()`  2M card=100k | 615.9ms | 95.6ms  | 6.44x | 0.43x -> 2.78x (pandas 265.7ms) |

All flip LOSS->WIN (low card too: 0.62-0.68x -> 2.9-3.5x). sem by Utf8 key (0.64-0.72x) is the last single-key gap —
separate path, next. FULL fp-frame suite 3109 passed / 0 failed.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — DataFrameGroupBy sem/skew/kurt by single Utf8 key dense moment path: 0.64x LOSS -> 2.9x WIN
The dense f64 moment engine `agg_typed_pairs_dense_f64_moments` (sem/skew/kurt) had a single-Int64-key branch and
multi-key branches but NO single-Utf8-key branch, so a single Utf8 key (contiguous or Scalar-backed) fell to the SipHash
build_groups + per-group Vec<Scalar> path. Added the Utf8 sibling of the Int64 branch via single_utf8_key_dense_grouping
+ moments_by_pair (the same engine the i64 path uses). Bit-identical: same sorted group order, same per-group moment.

Same-box best-of-6, 2M rows, f64 value col by Scalar-backed Utf8 key (`bench_dfgbu3`; fp computes the f64 col, matching
prior behavior — the fp-side ratio is the clean grouping measure), pandas 2.2.3 per-call:
| op | before | after | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `df.groupby(Utf8).sem()` 2M card=1000 | 64.1ms  | 33.3ms  | 1.92x | 1.54x -> 2.96x (pandas 98.9ms) |
| `df.groupby(Utf8).sem()` 2M card=100k | 544.9ms | 118.9ms | 4.58x | 0.64x -> 2.91x (pandas 346.4ms) |

Flips the high-card LOSS->WIN; skew/kurt share the engine. This closes the single-Utf8-key DataFrameGroupBy surface
(sum/mean/std/var/min/max/count/first/last/all/any/nunique/idxmax/idxmin/sem/skew/kurt all dense). FULL fp-frame suite
3109 passed / 0 failed.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — multi-key DataFrameGroupBy with Scalar-backed Utf8 keys: 0.08x LOSS -> 4.5x WIN (low-group) / 3x fp-side (high-group)
`multi_mixed_dense_grouping` (the dense product-table grouping for mixed Int64/Utf8 multi-keys) handled each Utf8 key
only via `as_utf8_contiguous()`, so a single Scalar-backed (from_values) Utf8 key in the by-list made the WHOLE
multi-key grouping fall to the SipHash build_groups path (per-row Vec<ScalarKey> + composite SipHash) — catastrophic at
high group counts. Changed the Utf8 branch to factorize via `pivot_utf8_key_strs` (covers both backings). Bit-identical:
same first-seen factorize codes/inverse ⇒ same product-table gids, sorted group order, and MultiIndex labels.

Same-box best-of-6, 2M rows, TWO Scalar-backed Utf8 keys + f64 value (`bench_dfgb2u`), pandas 2.2.3 per-call:
| op | before | after | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `df.groupby([u8,u8]).sum()` 2M ~10k groups  | 167.0ms  | 58.0ms   | 2.88x | 1.56x -> 4.48x (pandas 260.1ms) |
| `df.groupby([u8,u8]).count()` 2M ~10k groups | 151.1ms  | 56.0ms   | 2.70x | 1.12x -> 3.03x (pandas 169.6ms) |
| `df.groupby([u8,u8]).sum()` 2M ~1M groups   | 4214.2ms | 1398.3ms | 3.01x | 0.08x -> 0.25x (pandas 353.2ms) |

Low-group flips to a strong WIN; ~1M-group improves 3x fp-side but stays a LOSS — the residual is the 1M-group output
assembly (key_of_gid's per-group Vec<MixedKey> String materialization + MultiIndex build), a separate output-bound
issue from the grouping. FULL fp-frame suite 3109 passed / 0 failed.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — DataFrame.sort_values by Scalar-backed Utf8 column: 0.59x LOSS -> 3.55x WIN
`sort_values_na`'s Utf8 fast path (call `argsort_with`, a stable MSD byte radix) gated on
`sort_column.as_utf8_contiguous().is_some()` — so a Scalar-backed (from_values) Utf8 sort key fell to the generic
O(n log n) `compare_scalars_with_na_position` sort over materialized Scalars (~2.3s at 2M rows). But `argsort_with`
ALREADY radix-sorts BOTH backings (raw &[u8] spans for contiguous, `utf8_msd_argsort` over &str for the Scalar-backed
case). Relaxed the gate to any all-valid Utf8 column (na_position='last'). Bit-identical: the exact same argsort_with
call + reorder, just now reached for the non-contiguous backing.

Same-box best-of-6, 2M rows, sort by a Scalar-backed Utf8 column (`bench_dfu`), pandas 2.2.3 per-call:
| op | before | after | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `df.sort_values(Utf8)` 2M card=10000 | 2319.6ms | 387.2ms | 5.99x | 0.59x -> 3.55x (pandas 1376.1ms) |

Flips a big LOSS->WIN. FULL fp-frame suite 3109 passed / 0 failed.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — DataFrame dedup by single Scalar-backed Utf8 subset: 0.60x LOSS, all levers REJECTED (~0-gain/regression)
`duplicated_mask` gates its single-Utf8 fast path on `as_utf8_contiguous()`, so a Scalar-backed (from_values) Utf8
subset falls to the generic per-cell Scalar digest path: `df.drop_duplicates(["k"])` 51ms / `df.duplicated(["k"])` 38ms
vs pandas 30.4ms / 29.7ms (0.60x / 0.78x) at 2M rows, 10k distinct. Tried THREE levers, all measured and reverted:
1. Materialize key to contiguous + reuse `duplicated_single_utf8` → 51->90ms (REGRESSION; the 40MB span copy is pure
   overhead the existing generic digest avoids).
2. Direct `FxHashMap<&str>` dedup, pre-sized to n (mirror of duplicated_single_utf8) → 51->84ms (REGRESSION; a 2M-cap
   hashmap is cache-cold at 10k distinct).
3. Direct `FxHashMap<&str>` dedup, grow-from-small → 51->47.7ms / 38->35.5ms (only ~7%, does NOT flip the loss).
None beat the loss vs pandas. The residual is the string-dedup hashtable itself (2M short-string probes into a cache-
cold map) — pandas' khash is faster; closing it needs an open-addressing string table / radix dedup, not a fast-path
reroute. REVERTED per ~0-gain. (Distinct from the sort_values/groupby Utf8 wins, which rerouted to an EXISTING fast
kernel; here the generic path already is the hash dedup.) FULL fp-frame suite green at HEAD (unchanged).

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — set_index by Scalar-backed Utf8 column: 0.13x -> 0.46x (3.6x fp-side; partial — pandas zero-copy residual)
`set_index`'s contiguous-Utf8 fast path (lazy Utf8 index over the immutable Arc backing, no per-row String) gated on
`utf8_contiguous_arcs()`, so a Scalar-backed (from_values) Utf8 column fell to the generic path that allocates one
`IndexLabel::Utf8(String)` PER ROW (2M small allocs). Added a branch that materializes the strings into ONE contiguous
buffer (single big alloc + sequential copy) then builds the same `from_utf8_contiguous` lazy index. Bit-identical (the
lazy index materializes the identical per-row strings).

Same-box best-of-6, 2M rows, set_index by a Scalar-backed Utf8 column (`bench_dfu`), pandas 2.2.3 per-call:
| op | before | after | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `df.set_index(Utf8)` 2M card=10000 | 86.9ms | 23.9ms | 3.64x | 0.13x -> 0.46x (pandas 11.0ms) |

3.6x fp-side improvement (one big alloc replacing 2M small ones), but stays a LOSS — pandas' set_index is near-free (the
index shares the column's object array; no copy). fp's lazy Utf8 index needs a CONTIGUOUS byte buffer, so a Scalar-backed
column must be copied once; matching pandas needs an index representation that borrows the column's Scalar Strings
(structural). Also confirmed dominant this turn (no gap): groupby by Datetime64 key (sum 4.4x / count 2.5-3.7x WIN);
agg(list)/agg(dict) by Utf8 key (dispatch through the already-fixed gb.count/first/last/min/max/named_func). FULL
fp-frame suite 3109 passed / 0 failed.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — multi-key merge on Scalar-backed Utf8 keys: 0.62-0.73x LOSS (SURFACED; lever = dense_packed multi-key)
`merge_dataframes_on` on TWO Scalar-backed Utf8 keys is a moderate LOSS: inner 796.7ms (pandas 583.4 = 0.73x), left
785.5ms (pandas 487.6 = 0.62x) at 2M-left × 1M-right (card=1000), `bench_merge2u`. Root cause: the multi-key path runs
`collect_composite_keys`, which for each row builds a `CompositeJoinKey` SmallVec<[JoinKeyComponent;1]> (2 elems >
inline ⇒ heap spill per row) and calls `scalar_to_key_component` per cell, which for Utf8 does
`IndexLabel::Utf8(v.clone())` — a String clone per key cell (4M+ clones across both sides). The single-key Utf8 merge
WINS (no composite SmallVec; bench_merge_utf8 2-3x), and a bounded-Int64 composite already has a dense packed-CSR path
(merge ~line 7036/7740). LEVER (the codebase's OPEN "dense_packed multi-key", join-vein memory): factorize each Utf8
key column over left∪right to shared u32 codes (one FxHashMap<&str> pass/side/column), pack the per-row codes into one
i64, and feed the EXISTING dense Int64 composite CSR — matching on codes, output gathering the original columns by
position. Replaces 4M String clones + 2M SmallVec spills with 2 factorize passes + i64 packing. NOT attempted here:
intricate fp-join change (null/Missing class, duplicate-cardinality multiplication, sort/outer ordering) — too risky to
land half-tested in the time box. Surfaced with bench + lever for a focused session. (Conformance GREEN; no source change.)

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — DataFrameGroupBy head/tail (+nth) by Utf8 key dense path: 0.91x LOSS -> 3.6-5.1x WIN
`dense_group_positions` (the per-group row-position selector behind df.groupby(k).head()/tail()/nth()) gated the single
key on `as_i64_slice` — so ANY Utf8 key (contiguous OR Scalar-backed) fell to build_groups + per-group index Vec. Routed
the single Utf8 key through `single_utf8_key_dense_grouping` (it only needs gid_per_row + ng; labels/order unused — the
output gathers original rows by position). Bit-identical: same per-group row-order positions, same ascending kept-row
set as the build_groups path.

Same-box best-of-6, 2M rows by Scalar-backed Utf8 key (`bench_dfgbu3`), pandas 2.2.3 per-call:
| op | before | after | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `df.groupby(Utf8).head(5)` 2M card=100k | 420.6ms | 105.6ms | 3.98x | 0.91x -> 3.61x (pandas 381.0ms) |
| `df.groupby(Utf8).tail(5)` 2M card=100k | 598.8ms | 107.9ms | 5.55x | 0.92x -> 5.11x (pandas 551.2ms) |
| `df.groupby(Utf8).nth(0)`  2M card=100k | 367.8ms | 305.4ms | 1.20x | 0.92x -> 1.11x (pandas 337.6ms) |

head/tail flip to strong WINs; nth improves to a slight win (it does extra non-dense_group_positions work — a deeper
nth path is the residual). Also confirmed dominant this turn (no gap): DataFrame numeric rank 27.6x / corr 16.4x /
nlargest 28x / nunique 12.3x WINS; groupby transform already handles Scalar-backed Utf8. FULL fp-frame suite 3109 / 0.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — DataFrameGroupBy nth() by Utf8 key dense path: 0.92x -> 3.12x WIN
Follow-up to head/tail: nth() has its OWN inline dense path (not dense_group_positions) gated on `as_i64_slice`, so a
Utf8 key still fell to build_groups. Routed the single Utf8 key through `single_utf8_key_dense_grouping` (needs
gid_per_row + ng + order — nth emits one row per group in group order). Bit-identical: same nth-row-per-group + same
group order as build_groups.

Same-box best-of-6, 2M rows by Scalar-backed Utf8 key (`bench_dfgbu3`), pandas 2.2.3 per-call:
| op | before | after | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `df.groupby(Utf8).nth(0)` 2M card=100k | 305.4ms | 108.1ms | 2.82x | 0.92x -> 3.12x (pandas 337.6ms) |

Completes the head/tail/nth row-selection trio for Utf8 keys. FULL fp-frame suite 3109 passed / 0 failed.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — reshape + multi-key row-selection surface CONFIRMED DOMINANT (no gap)
Swept several common ops vs pandas 2.2.3 (same-box best-of-6); all WIN, no lever needed — recorded so agents skip them:
- `df.melt(id, value_vars)` numeric: 200k×10 43.8ms vs 79.0 (1.80x), 1M×10 351.5ms vs 454.9 (1.29x) WIN (`bench_melt`).
- `df.groupby([utf8,utf8]).head(5)` 2M/10k-groups: 87.3ms vs 165.7 (1.90x WIN); `.nth(0)` 79.4ms vs 163.0 (2.05x WIN)
  — multi-key head/nth fall to build_groups (dense_group_positions/nth gate by.len()==1), but pandas' multi-key path is
  slower, so fp WINS anyway; extending to multi_mixed_dense would only grow an existing win, NOT close a loss.
- DataFrame numeric (prior entry): rank 27.6x / corr 16.4x / nlargest 28x / nunique 12.3x WINS.
- groupby transform by Utf8 key: already dense (transform_dense_gids has a &str branch).
The ONLY remaining vs-pandas LOSSES are the documented STRUCTURAL ones: multi-key Utf8 merge 0.62x (dense_packed
factorize-to-codes), 1M-group multi-key groupby output assembly 0.25x (categorical MultiIndex / Vec<MixedKey> String
materialization), single-Utf8-subset DataFrame dedup 0.60x (string-hashtable khash floor), and the f64-comparison
Vec<bool> bandwidth 0.40x (packed-bitmask Bool). All need multi-hour structural work, not a fast-path reroute.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — multi-key Utf8 merge dense_packed lever PROTOTYPED & VALIDATED (inner 5.8x on match phase)
Prototyped the lever from the prior merge entry directly in `bench_merge2u`: pre-factorize each Utf8 key column over
left∪right to shared i64 codes, then merge on the i64-code key columns (the existing dense Int64 composite CSR).
Same-box best-of-6, 2M-left × 1M-right, card=1000, timing ONLY the merge call (factorize done outside the loop, as a
real impl would amortize / it mirrors the work the Utf8 hash-composite path already does inline):
| op | Utf8 keys (now) | i64-CODED (lever) | speedup |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| inner | 762.1ms | 130.8ms | 5.83x |
| left  | 758.5ms | 519.0ms | 1.46x |

The lever PAYS — inner merge on codes is 5.8x faster (the dense Int64 composite CSR vs the per-row Vec<JoinKeyComponent>
SmallVec + String-clone composite + hash). vs pandas 583ms (inner), a real impl (factorize ~100ms + 130ms merge ≈ 230ms)
flips 0.73x LOSS -> ~2.5x WIN. NOT landed: the in-place wrapper (factorize→code-frames→merge→map output codes back to
Utf8) is correctness-critical — output ORDER must match pandas across join types. Inner/left (left-position order,
encoding-independent) are safe; outer/right (key-sorted order: codes are first-seen, not lexicographic) are NOT and must
keep the Utf8 path. Implementable with an inner/left gate + the existing dense path, but needs careful order-conformance
verification (a merge order bug is data-corruption-adjacent) — a focused session, not a 60m patch. Prototype retained in
bench_merge2u. Conformance GREEN (bench + docs only).

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — nullable Float64 abs/round/compare_scalar typed paths: 0.004-0.065x -> 0.26-0.45x (4.5-108x fp-side)
Real data has NaN. The all-valid `as_f64_slice` fast paths bail on ANY NaN, so a nullable (10%-null) Float64 column fell
to the per-element Scalar dispatch: 5M abs 384ms / round 403ms / gt_scalar 416ms — 18x/15x/237x slower than pandas.
Added nullable typed paths over `as_f64_slice_with_validity`: compare_scalar emits a typed nullable Bool via
`from_bool_values_with_validity` (invalid⇒Null, bit-identical to the Scalar path's `Null(Null)`); abs/round compute the
present slots over the raw &[f64], write NaN at invalid slots, and re-ingest via the canonical `from_f64_values` (which
re-derives validity from NaN — bit-identical to the loop's missing handling; abs/round never turn a present value into
the only-at-missing NaN). NOTE: my first abs/round attempt used `from_f64_values_owned_with_validity` and FAILED tests —
its all-valid-claiming backing ignores the validity field at missing slots; the from_f64_values re-ingest is the correct
(if copying) path.

Same-box best-of-6, 5M Float64 10%-null (`fp-frame/examples/bench_nullable`), pandas 2.2.3:
| op | before | after | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `gt_scalar` (s>0.5) | 415.6ms | 3.9ms  | 107x  | 0.004x -> 0.45x (pandas 1.75ms) |
| `abs`               | 383.7ms | 81.0ms | 4.74x | 0.056x -> 0.26x (pandas 21.4ms) |
| `round(2)`          | 402.7ms | 90.0ms | 4.47x | 0.065x -> 0.30x (pandas 26.2ms) |

Catastrophic LOSS -> moderate (gt_scalar fixes the whole compare family lt/eq/ne/ge/le). Residual vs pandas is the
validity rebuild (from_f64_values' NaN scan + Arc::from copy) — pandas does NaN ops in-place with no validity model.
A non-copying nullable-f64 constructor (fixing from_f64_values_owned_with_validity's backing) is the next lever.
fp-columnar 467/0, fp-frame 3109/0.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — nullable Float64 neg typed path: 0.038x -> 0.27x (7.2x fp-side)
Continuation of the nullable-f64 vein: neg() on a 10%-null Float64 column fell to the per-element Scalar loop (5M neg
584ms / 26x slower than pandas). Added the same nullable typed path as abs (negate present slots over raw &[f64], NaN
at invalid, re-ingest via from_f64_values). Bit-identical: -x of a present non-NaN value is never NaN. 584->80.6ms,
0.038x -> 0.27x (pandas 22.1ms). fp-columnar 467/0, fp-frame 3109/0. STILL OPEN in this vein (all measured, same Scalar
floor): sqrt 0.062x (UNSAFE for from_f64_values — sqrt(negative present)=NaN would be wrongly marked missing; needs
present-NaN preservation), exp 0.139x (safe, not yet done), diff 0.049x / cummax 0.168x / cummin 0.174x (cumulative,
different pattern). The non-copying nullable-f64 constructor remains the deeper lever for all of them.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — nullable Float64 transcendentals sqrt/exp/log: 0.06-0.14x LOSS -> 1.3-2.5x WIN
The shared helper `typed_float_unary_nullable_owned_par` (used by sqrt/log; it already handles fn-PRODUCED NaN, e.g.
sqrt(neg), via an output validity scan) gated on `as_f64_slice` = all-valid INPUT, so a nullable Float64 input fell to
the per-element Scalar loop (5M 10%-null: sqrt 394ms / exp 408ms / log similar, 7-16x slower than pandas). Added a
nullable-input branch (invalid slot ⇒ NaN ⇒ marked missing by the same scan, bit-identical to those ops' Scalar
`missing ⇒ Float64(NaN)` arm) and routed exp through this helper (was on the all-valid-only `typed_float_unary_par`).
Uses the OWNED constructor (MOVE, no from_f64_values copy) — much faster than the abs/neg from_f64_values path.

Same-box best-of-6, 5M Float64 10%-null (`fp-frame/examples/bench_nullable`), pandas 2.2.3:
| op | before | after | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `sqrt` | 394.2ms | 18.7ms | 21.1x | 0.062x -> 1.32x (pandas 24.6ms) |
| `exp`  | 407.5ms | 22.8ms | 17.9x | 0.139x -> 2.47x (pandas 56.4ms) |

Both FLIP LOSS->WIN (log shares the helper → same fix). One helper change covers the whole transcendental family on
nullable input. fp-columnar 467/0, fp-frame 3109/0. Still open in vein: diff 0.049x, cummax/cummin 0.168x (cumulative).

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — nullable Float64 diff typed path: 0.049x -> 0.53x (10.8x fp-side)
diff() on a nullable Float64 column fell to the per-element Scalar loop (5M 10%-null: 459ms, 20x slower than pandas).
Added a nullable typed path mirroring the all-valid one: subtract over the raw &[f64], clear the validity bit where the
slot is out of range OR either operand is missing, emit via the validity-respecting `from_f64_values_with_validity`
(0.0-datum + cleared-bit ⇒ Null(NaN), the same convention the all-valid path + generic path use). Bit-identical
(present pair ⇒ Float64(data[i]-data[j]); boundary/missing-operand ⇒ Null(NaN)). 459->42.6ms, 0.049x -> 0.53x
(pandas 22.7ms). fp-frame 3109/0. Still open: cummax/cummin 0.168x (cumulative running-extremum, different pattern).

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — nullable Float64 cummax/cummin typed paths: 0.168x LOSS -> 2.0-2.1x WIN
cummax()/cummin() on a nullable Float64 column fell to the per-element Scalar loop (5M 10%-null: 426/433ms, 6x slower
than pandas). Added nullable typed paths: running extremum over the raw &[f64] — a present slot folds into `acc`
(seeded -inf/+inf) and emits it; a missing slot clears its validity bit and SKIPS the fold (skipna). Emit via the
validity-respecting `from_f64_values_with_validity`. Bit-identical to the generic loop (present ⇒ Float64(acc); missing
⇒ Null(NaN)).

Same-box best-of-6, 5M Float64 10%-null (`bench_nullable`), pandas 2.2.3:
| op | before | after | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `cummax` | 426.1ms | 35.1ms | 12.2x | 0.168x -> 2.04x (pandas 71.7ms) |
| `cummin` | 433.4ms | 35.4ms | 12.2x | 0.174x -> 2.13x (pandas 75.3ms) |

Both FLIP LOSS->WIN. Closes the nullable-f64 elementwise vein opened this session (compare/abs/round/neg/sqrt/exp/log/
diff/cummax/cummin all now typed-fast). fp-frame 3109/0.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — nullable Float64 binary arithmetic (col OP col): 0.057x LOSS, typed-output REJECTED (parity wall)
Nullable f64+f64 (and *, -, /) falls to `aligned_binary_f64_same_positions`' per-element Scalar tail: 5M 10%-null
add_col 419ms / mul_col 411ms vs pandas 24ms (0.057x / 17x slower). Tried a typed output (write apply(l,r), validity =
lvalid&rvalid). REVERTED — breaks the locked `aligned_binary_f64_same_positions_matches_general_path_for_all_ops_with_nan_inf`
parity test. The general Scalar tail makes THREE distinct representations the typed constructors can't all reproduce at
once: both-valid finite ⇒ present Float64(v); both-valid GENERATED NaN (inf-inf, 0/0) ⇒ PRESENT Float64(NaN); either
operand missing ⇒ Null(NaN) (missing). `from_f64_values` re-derives validity from NaN (makes missing-operand
Float64(NaN), not Null(NaN)); `from_f64_values_with_validity` with an explicit mask re-marks set-bit NaN as missing
(makes generated-NaN Null, not present Float64(NaN)). Neither matches `Self::new(Float64,…)`'s exact present-NaN vs
Null-NaN split. CLEAN FIX needs a constructor mirroring Self::new's NaN handling, OR a two-mask path distinguishing
input-missing (→Null) from generated-NaN (→present Float64(NaN)) — a focused constructor change, not a 60m reroute.
(Also confirmed dominant this turn: nullable clip 2.1x WIN, fillna ~parity.) Conformance GREEN (bench+docs only).

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — nullable f64 arithmetic (col+col AND col+scalar): EXACT blocker pinned = one missing constructor
Sharpening the prior binary-arith rejection after tracing the scalar path too (apply_scalar_op_inner, 64089): BOTH
nullable f64+f64 (419ms, 0.057x) and f64+scalar fall to a per-element Scalar Vec because no typed f64 constructor
reproduces the general path's exact per-slot Scalar representation. The general paths need, simultaneously:
  (a) missing-operand / missing-input slot ⇒ `Scalar::Null(NullKind::NaN)`  (a MISSING slot, Null representation)
  (b) generated NaN at a present slot (inf-inf, a/0, NaN**0) ⇒ for col+col via `Self::new` ⇒ PRESENT `Float64(NaN)`;
      for scalar via `from_values` ⇒ MISSING — i.e. the two general paths themselves DIFFER, and a typed replacement
      must match each respectively.
Available constructors: `from_f64_values` re-derives validity from NaN AND renders missing as `Float64(NaN)` (fails (a):
gives Float64(NaN) not Null); `from_f64_values_with_validity` renders cleared bits as `Null(NaN)` (✓ for (a)) but
re-marks SET-bit NaN as missing (fails col+col's present-Float64(NaN) in (b)); `from_f64_values_owned_with_validity`
ignores the validity field entirely (fails (a)). THE FIX (next session): add a constructor `from_f64_data_explicit_validity(
data, validity)` that emits `Null(NaN)` for cleared bits and a PRESENT `Float64(datum)` (NaN included) for set bits — NO
NaN re-derivation — then col+col uses validity=lvalid&rvalid, and scalar uses from_f64_values (its general path already
marks generated-NaN missing). Verified blocked, not landed (parity test
`aligned_binary_f64_same_positions_matches_general_path_for_all_ops_with_nan_inf` enforces it). Conformance GREEN (docs only).

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — nullable Float64 binary arithmetic SOLVED: 0.057x -> 0.44x (7.7x fp-side) via LazyNullableFloat64
The constructor pinned as "missing" in the entry above ALREADY EXISTS: `ScalarValues::lazy_nullable_float64(data,
validity)`. Its materialization renders a cleared-bit-with-NaN-datum as a PRESENT `Float64(NaN)` and a
cleared-bit-with-non-NaN-datum as `Null(NaN)` — exactly the three-way representation the general path needs. Rewrote
`aligned_binary_f64_same_positions`' nullable Scalar tail: both-valid ⇒ store apply(l,r), SET the bit only when the
result is non-NaN (generated NaN ⇒ cleared bit + NaN datum ⇒ present Float64(NaN)); missing-operand ⇒ 0.0 + cleared ⇒
Null(NaN). Bit-identical (value bits AND validity) — PASSES the locked
`aligned_binary_f64_same_positions_matches_general_path_for_all_ops_with_nan_inf` parity test.

Same-box best-of-6, 5M Float64 10%-null (`bench_nullable`), pandas 2.2.3:

fp-frame 3109/0. (Scalar-arith path, apply_scalar_op_inner, can use the same backing next — same representation.)

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — nullable Float64 scalar arithmetic (df OP scalar): 0.050x -> 0.60x (12.1x fp-side)
Reused the LazyNullableFloat64 lever from the col+col fix. Extracted a pub constructor
`Column::from_f64_values_nullable(data, validity)` (LazyNullableFloat64-backed, no NaN re-derivation), and added a
nullable Float64 fast path to `apply_scalar_op_inner` (DataFrame df+scalar / -scalar / *scalar / etc.): apply over the
raw &[f64], set the validity bit only where present AND result non-NaN, emit via the new constructor. Bit-identical to
the Scalar map (present ⇒ Float64(op); missing ⇒ Null(NaN); generated NaN ⇒ present Float64(NaN), validity cleared) —
fp-frame 3109/0 incl. DataFrame-arith-with-NaN tests.

Same-box best-of-6, 5M Float64 10%-null, df + 1.0 (`bench_dfscalar`), pandas 2.2.3:

Completes the nullable-f64 arithmetic surface (col+col AND col+scalar). The reusable
`from_f64_values_nullable` constructor is now available for any other typed nullable-f64 op output. fp-columnar 467/0,
fp-frame 3109/0.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — nullable Float64 between(): 0.018x -> 0.25x (14.1x fp-side)
between() on a nullable Float64 column fell to the per-element Scalar loop (5M 10%-null: 287ms, 56x slower than pandas).
The output is an ALL-VALID Bool (the Scalar path emits Bool(false) for a missing value, not a missing Bool), so added a
typed nullable path over `as_f64_slice_with_validity`: present ⇒ the same hoisted-per-mode f64 predicate; missing ⇒
false. Emit via from_bool_values. Bit-identical to the Scalar loop. 287->20.4ms, 0.018x -> 0.25x (pandas 5.1ms).
fp-frame 3109/0. (Also confirmed this turn: nullable ffill 1.16x WIN, interpolate 7.6x WIN, bfill ~parity — no gap.)

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — nullable Float64 clip_with_series(): 0.33x LOSS -> 1.60x WIN
clip(lower=Series, upper=Series) on a nullable Float64 value column fell to the generic per-element Scalar clip (the
typed block's `none_missing` gate excludes a nullable value): 5M 10%-null clip_series 463ms / 3x slower than pandas.
Added a nullable-value + all-valid-f64-bounds + same-index path: clip present slots over the raw &[f64] (NaN at missing),
re-ingest via from_f64_values. Bit-identical (present ⇒ Float64(r.max(lo).min(hi)); missing ⇒ Float64(NaN) == val.clone()
of a missing f64; max/min of a present finite value never yields NaN). 463->95.9ms, 0.33x -> 1.60x WIN (pandas 154ms).
fp-frame 3109/0. (Also confirmed this turn: nullable isin 1.49x WIN — no gap.)

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — nullable Float64 where/mask/where_series: 0.018-0.17x -> 0.77-1.10x (up to 44x fp-side)
Conditional-select on a nullable Float64 column fell to the per-element Scalar map / generic align path (the all-valid
as_f64_slice select bails on ANY NaN): 5M 10%-null where 183ms, mask 186ms, where_series (where_cond_series) 1674ms —
6x/6x/55x slower than pandas. Added nullable typed selects over `as_f64_slice_with_validity` emitting via the
LazyNullableFloat64-backed `from_f64_values_nullable`: out[i] = select(cond, ...), validity bit set iff the SELECTED
operand is valid there, CARRYING the selected operand's raw datum at a cleared slot so it renders EXACTLY as that
operand's `val.clone()` (Float64(NaN) or Null). Bit-identical (fp-frame 3109/0).

Same-box best-of-6, 5M Float64 10%-null (`bench_nullable`), pandas 2.2.3:
| op | before | after | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |

| `mask(cond, fill)`         | 186.2ms  | 29.8ms | 6.25x  | 0.16x -> 1.03x WIN (pandas 30.7ms) |
| `where(cond, other_series)`| 1673.9ms | 39.2ms | 42.7x  | 0.018x -> 0.77x (pandas 30.3ms) |

where/mask FLIP LOSS->WIN; where_series 0.018x->0.77x (44x fp-side, near parity). The LazyNullableFloat64 lever now
spans the full nullable-f64 select surface. fp-frame 3109/0.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — DataFrame axis=1 reductions on nullable f64: 0.34x LOSS -> 2.2-4.1x WIN (one reduce_rows change)
df.sum/mean/max/std(axis=1) on an all-Float64 frame WITH NaN: the all-valid axis=1 accumulators (reduce_rows_f64 /
reduce_rows_func_f64) bail on any NaN, so it fell to reduce_rows' per-cell `values()[idx]` Scalar materialization (k*n
boxings): 1M x 20 10%-null sum 627ms / mean 630ms / max 614ms / std 646ms (2.6-2.9x slower than pandas; std 0.74x).
Added a typed Float64 fast path at the TOP of reduce_rows: gather each row's PRESENT values (validity-set AND not-NaN ==
the is_missing skipna filter) from the raw &[f64] + validity, then the same empty-row -> `empty` / Float64(func(present))
emit. Bit-identical (fp-frame 3109/0). Serves ALL axis=1 reducers uniformly.

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — groupby by a NULLABLE key: 0.20-0.37x LOSS (SURFACED; lever = sentinel-gid dropna dense grouping)
SeriesGroupBy by a nullable i64 key (10% missing): sum 64.8ms (0.37x), count 103.5ms (0.20x) vs pandas 23.9/20.8ms at
2M, card=1000 (`bench_gbnull`). The dense grouping (dense_group_ids / int64_dense_grouping) gates the KEY on `as_i64_slice`
(= all-valid), so a nullable key falls to SipHash build_groups + per-group Scalar gather (~3-5x slower). pandas drops
missing keys by default (dropna=True). LEVER: a nullable-key dense path that reads `as_i64_slice_with_validity` (and the
Utf8 sibling), assigns a SENTINEL gid (usize::MAX) to missing-key rows so they're EXCLUDED from the output, dense-groups
the present keys. NOT landed: dense_group_ids' current contract is "every row gets a gid in 0..ngroups"; a sentinel
breaks EVERY consumer (dense_group_fold, dense_group_var_std, the count/first/last/idxmax/head paths) — each `acc[g]`
would index OOB on a MAX gid. Needs either a swept sentinel-skip across all consumers OR a per-consumer nullable-key
path, PLUS verifying fp's build_groups dropna matches pandas exactly first. A focused grouping session, not a 60m reroute.
(Also confirmed dominant this turn: DataFrame axis=0 median 2.3x WIN, std 32x WIN, sum/mean/var fast — no gap.)

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — nullable Utf8 str ops + nullable surface status: CONFIRMED DOMINANT (no gap)
Swept str ops on a nullable Utf8 Series (10% missing, 2M) vs pandas 2.2.3 object-str (`bench_strnull`) — all WIN or parity
(pandas object str.* is Python-level and slow, so fp's nullable str path wins even though it's slower than all-valid
contiguous): upper 198ms vs 208 (1.05x), len 161 vs 219 (1.35x), contains 180 vs 277 (1.53x), startswith 146 vs 179
(1.22x). No lever.
NULLABLE-F64 VEIN STATUS (this session): comprehensively closed. Fixed/typed-fast: compare family (108x), abs/round/neg
(4.7-7.2x), sqrt/exp/log (flipped to WIN), diff (10.8x), cummax/cummin (flipped to WIN), between (14x), clip_with_series
(flipped to WIN), where/mask/where_series (up to 44x; where/mask flipped to WIN), col+col AND col+scalar arithmetic (via
the new LazyNullableFloat64-backed `from_f64_values_nullable` constructor), DataFrame axis=1 sum/mean/max/std (flipped to
WIN, one reduce_rows change). Confirmed already-dominant (no gap): nullable sum/mean/std/var (Series + DF axis=0),
median axis=0 (2.3x), isin (1.49x), ffill (1.16x), interpolate (7.6x), all str ops. ONLY remaining nullable gap:
groupby-by-nullable-KEY (0.20-0.37x, surfaced above — needs the sentinel-gid dropna sweep).

### 2026-06-29 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy by a NULLABLE Int64 key: 0.20-0.37x LOSS -> 0.82x/0.88x/1.49x (+ correctness: drops the null group to match pandas)
The previously-surfaced groupby-by-nullable-KEY gap (the "ONLY remaining nullable gap" above) is CLOSED — and it
turned out to ALSO be a latent correctness divergence. `SeriesGroupBy::build_groups` had no dropna handling: a missing
key (Null / NaN-float / NaT) was kept as a spurious `Utf8("NaN")` group, whereas pandas drops missing-key rows
(`dropna=True` default; SeriesGroupBy exposes no dropna=False). DataFrameGroupBy already dropped them
(`self.dropna && key_cols...is_missing() => continue`); SeriesGroupBy was the lone offender. Verified empirically:
fp `[NaN-group, 1, 0]` vs pandas `[0.0, 1.0]` (pandas 2.2.3). The conformance proptest `prop_groupby_sum_dropna_*`
only checks `IndexLabel::Null` (the spurious group is `Utf8("NaN")`, so it slipped through) AND tests the conformance
crate's own reference oracle, not fp-frame's SeriesGroupBy — so the divergence was untested.

FIX (one place, whole surface): (1) generic `build_groups` loop now `continue`s on `val.is_missing()` (dropna) — fixes
sum/mean/count/std/var/agg_scalar/first/last/etc. at once. (2) a hash-free dense direct-address path for a NULLABLE
bounded-Int64 key (`as_i64_slice_with_validity` + new `i64_dense_histogram_range_valid` over the VALID span) that skips
missing-key rows and direct-addresses present keys — bit-identical to the dropna-corrected generic path (present keys
first-seen order, ascending row indices per group). (3) a sister dense count path (all-valid value + nullable bounded
key) so count's `.values()[idx].is_missing()` per-group materialization is bypassed. Updated the one test that pinned
the OLD buggy behavior (`null_nan_metamorphic_series_groupby_missing_key_isolation_tn6qb6`) to the pandas-correct
labels — its real metamorphic invariant (present groups isolated from dropped missing-key rows) still holds and is
strengthened. fp-frame lib 3109/0.

Same-box best-of-6, 2M Int64 10%-null key, card=1000, Float64 value (`bench_gbnull`), pandas 2.2.3:

| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `sum`   | 64.8ms  | 28.3ms | 2.29x | 0.37x -> 0.82x (pandas 24.2ms) |
| `mean`  | ~69ms   | 27.1ms | 2.5x  | ~0.36x -> 0.88x (pandas 25.1ms) |
| `count` | 103.5ms | 13.7ms | 7.55x | 0.20x -> 1.49x WIN (pandas 20.5ms) |

count FLIPS to a WIN; sum/mean from deep-loss to near-parity. All three now drop the null-key group exactly as pandas
(correctness fix, not just perf). NOTE: the earlier-feared "sentinel-gid sweep across every dense consumer" was NOT
needed — fixing `build_groups` + adding a nullable-key dense path (which simply skips missing-key rows, no sentinel in
the shared gid layout) covers the reduction surface without touching `dense_group_ids`/`dense_group_fold`'s all-valid
contract. Pre-existing unrelated conformance flake `prop_series_where_and_mask_series_are_condition_duals` (where/mask,
NOT groupby) confirmed failing on clean baseline with this change stashed — not introduced here.

### 2026-06-30 BlackThrush — cut (equal-width binning) typed-input fast path: 0.33x/0.40x -> 0.40x/0.51x (1.21x/1.26x fp-side); residual loss is STRUCTURAL (Utf8 output vs pandas Categorical)
Whole-surface re-survey (bench_survey2, 5M, best-of-6, pandas 2.2.3) confirmed the surface is dominated — rank_i64
1.57x, argsort_i64 1.19x, nlargest 2.0x, nsmallest 1.41x, median 3.4x, clip_series 5.4x, value_counts/nunique/unique
all win — EXCEPT `cut`, the one clear loss: cut_i64 0.33x (496ms vs pandas 164ms), cut_f64 0.40x (375ms vs 151ms).
factorize wide-i64 (the old "KHASH floor") re-measured 2.24x WIN — that gap is long closed.

CAUSE (two parts): (a) INPUT — cut_i64 fell to the generic `series.values()` arm, boxing all n values into Scalars
(the `as_f64_slice` typed path only fired for Float64); even cut_f64 built a redundant `Vec<Option<f64>>` (80MB @5M)
+ a separate `valid: Vec<f64>` copy (40MB) purely to compute min/max. (b) OUTPUT — pandas `pd.cut` returns a
Categorical (n 1-byte codes + ~10 category strings); fp's cut is conformance-LOCKED to a Utf8 Series of interval
strings (strict packet FP-P2D-081 pins `utf8` values), so it MUST materialize n full label strings (~110MB of
bytes+offsets @5M) — a strictly larger output than pandas produces. The per-row variable-length label memcpy dominates.

FIX (input only — the safe ceiling): a typed all-valid fast path handling BOTH `as_f64_slice` AND `as_i64_slice`,
reading the raw slice directly — one-pass min/max (folding each element as f64, exactly matching the generic `to_f64()`
fold), then emitting the pre-formatted interval labels into one contiguous byte buffer. No `Vec<Option<f64>>`, no `valid`
copy, no per-value Scalar materialization for the Int64 case. Bit-identical (verified vs pandas 2.2.3 for i64 and f64:
same edges, same 0.1%-widened first-left, same `((f-min)/width).ceil()-1` clamp, same labels). The bin-index division
is bit-locked (reciprocal-multiply would differ by ULPs and flip a boundary bin — the strict gate forbids it), and the
Utf8 output is dtype-locked, so this input-side win is the max achievable without changing cut's return dtype.

bench_survey2 5M, best-of-6 (3 stable runs), pandas 2.2.3:
| op | before | after | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

| `cut_f64` | 375ms | 297ms | 1.26x | 0.40x -> 0.51x (pandas 151ms) |

Residual loss is STRUCTURAL, same class as to_numpy/transpose (l4vzc): pandas returns a compact Categorical; fp's
conformance contract is a materialized Utf8 interval-string column. Closing it fully would require cut to return
`DType::Categorical` (codes+categories) — a return-dtype change that breaks the strict FP-P2D-081 Utf8 parity gate, so
NOT pursued. fp-frame lib green, cut/qcut conformance green.

### 2026-07-01 BlackThrush — rolling + expanding cov/corr: 0.53-0.87x LOSS -> 2.45-4.1x WIN (identity-align bypass + expanding typed path)
Re-survey (bench_rolling/bench_expanding, 1M, best-of-6, pandas 2.2.3) found the rolling/expanding pairwise moments the
only remaining losses (everything else dominates — str 1.5-16x, dt 7-16x, reshape 2-4.6x, ewm cov/corr already win,
factorize wide-i64 2.24x). Two distinct causes, both fixed:

(a) ROLLING cov/corr — `rolling_pairwise_moment` opened with `self.series.align(other, AlignMode::Left)`
UNCONDITIONALLY, even for co-indexed series (the overwhelmingly common `s.rolling(w).cov(other)` case). `align` builds an
n-entry `FxHashMap<i64,usize>` + n probes then `reindex_by_positions`-clones BOTH columns into two fresh Series — an
O(n) hashmap + 2 column copies that turned out to be ~70ms of the 88ms (the sliding power-sum recurrence itself is only
~17ms). FIX: identity fast path — when `*self.index() == *other.index() && !other.index().has_duplicates()`, a Left-align
is the identity, so use `other` directly (no hashmap, no reindex clones, no Series construction). Bit-identical (same
positions/values/union-index).

(b) EXPANDING cov/corr — `expanding_bivariate` had NO typed fast path: it materialized BOTH series to `Vec<Scalar>` and
dispatched `is_missing()`/`to_f64()` per element. FIX: an `as_f64_slice` all-valid fast path running the same online
bivariate Welford recurrence over the two raw &[f64] (sister to the rolling typed path), emitting a typed `Vec<f64>`
(NaN for pre-min_pairs / zero-std rows → `from_f64_values` renders `Null(NaN)`, matching the Scalar arm). Bit-identical.

Verified bit-identical vs pandas 2.2.3 (8-element probe, rolling w=3 AND expanding, cov AND corr — every value matched
incl. the NaN warmup rows). fp-frame lib green.

| `expanding().corr`  | 80.2ms | 15.8ms | 5.1x | 0.82x -> 4.14x WIN (pandas 65.4ms) |

All four FLIP LOSS->WIN. The identity-align bypass is the higher-leverage of the two (align was the entire rolling gap);
the expanding typed path mirrors the pattern already used by rolling. NOTE: ewm cov/corr already used `other.column()`
directly (no align) — no change needed there. window-independent (w=100 and w=1000 both ~17ms) confirms O(n) online.

### 2026-07-01 BlackThrush — read_csv (mixed CSV) generic-path raw-text capture: 0.47x -> 0.59x (1.24x fp-side); residual is a typed-parser gap
Re-survey found read_csv the biggest remaining gap vs pandas (cold parse of a mixed 500k×3 CSV — i64/f64/utf8, 17.8MB:
fp 304ms vs pandas 143ms = 0.47x). (Everything else dominates: to_csv 6.0x, df rank 18.5x / corr 15x / nlargest 25x /
nunique 11.7x, str 1.5-16x, dt 7-16x, reshape 2-4.6x.) A mixed CSV bails BOTH numeric fast paths on row 0 (cheap) and
falls to the generic per-cell path, which did `parse_scalar(field)` AND `field.to_owned()` for EVERY cell — ~1.5M
small-string mallocs into `raw_columns: Vec<Vec<String>>`, kept purely for the object-fallback verbatim rebuild.

Attribution: skipping the raw clone entirely dropped 304ms -> 193ms (the clone = ~36% of the parse). But `raw` IS needed
for a Utf8-result column with numeric-coerced cells (e.g. a "1.5"/"2.5"/"x" column must keep "1.5" verbatim, not a
reformat) — verified vs pandas 2.2.3 (mixed col preserved exactly; all-numeric "05"/"10"/"007" column stays Int64
[5,10,7] like pandas). FIX (safe, bit-identical): capture raw into ONE contiguous byte buffer + offsets per column
(`Vec<u8>`+`Vec<usize>`) instead of n `String` allocs; `build_csv_object_aware_column` indexes the contiguous form for
the Utf8 rebuild. Recovers ~60ms of the 110ms (the residual is the inherent 18MB byte copy). Options-path callers adapt
their `&[String]` raw via a small `strings_to_contiguous_raw` shim (unchanged behavior).

bench cold parse, 500k×3 mixed CSV (17.8MB), best-of-6, pandas 2.2.3:
| op | before | after | fp-side | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `read_csv` (mixed) | 304ms | 245ms | 1.24x | 0.47x -> 0.59x (pandas 143ms) |

Still a partial LOSS. The deeper lever (deferred): a single-pass TYPED-PER-COLUMN parser with a Utf8 variant, so a
mixed CSV parses each column directly into a typed/contiguous column WITHOUT the `Vec<Scalar>` + `from_values` +
Utf8-rebuild round-trip (the ~193ms floor with raw removed is still 1.35x pandas — that round-trip, not raw, is the
remaining cost). Bailing the numeric fast path to the Scalar generic path is the structural issue; a Utf8-promoting
typed path needs verbatim text for already-parsed numeric cells (can't stringify losslessly after the fact), so it
requires either two-pass type classification or per-cell raw offsets — a focused fp-io parser session, not a 60m reroute.

### 2026-07-01 BlackThrush — astype(Float64) on a Utf8 column: 0.70x LOSS -> 2.97x WIN (typed parse path in Column::astype)
Re-survey found `Series.astype(Float64)` on a string column a LOSS (1M f64-strings: fp 84ms vs pandas 60.7ms = 0.70x)
— striking because `to_numeric` on the SAME data was 26ms (5.9x WIN). fp's astype was 3.3x slower than its OWN
to_numeric: `Column::astype` had typed fast paths for Int64<->Float64 and *->Utf8 but NONE for Utf8->numeric, so a
string column fell to the generic `values().map(cast_scalar).collect() -> Self::new` per-cell Scalar path (Scalar
materialization + cast_scalar dispatch + revalidation).

FIX: a typed Utf8->Float64 path in Column::astype — parse each field's bytes straight from the contiguous buffer into a
Vec<f64>, then from_f64_values_owned (MOVE). `cast_scalar(Utf8(s), Float64)` is exactly `s.parse::<f64>()` (NO trim —
Rust f64::from_str rejects surrounding whitespace, matching), so bit-identical. `as_utf8_contiguous` gates all-valid, so
every cell is present; a cell parsing to NaN ("nan") OR a parse failure BAILS to the generic Scalar path, which
reproduces the exact NaN-present / raise-error behavior (verified: the generic path keeps "nan" as a PRESENT Float64(NaN),
NOT missing — so bailing on NaN, rather than routing through from_f64_values which would mark it missing, is what keeps
bit-identity). Verified vs pandas 2.2.3: clean [1.5,42,-3.25,1e3,inf,-inf,0,000123,3.0] EXACT, "nan"->NaN, "hello"->raise.

| `astype(Float64)` on Utf8 | 84.0ms | 20.5ms | 4.10x | 0.70x -> 2.97x WIN (pandas 60.7ms) |

FLIPS LOSS->WIN. fp-columnar 467/0. (Utf8->Int64 astype has the same generic-path shape — a natural follow-up sibling;
cast_scalar(Utf8,Int64) tries i64 then f64-with-fract==0, so a typed path would gate on that. Not landed this session.)
Also confirmed dominant this survey (no gap): to_csv 6.0x, read_json 1.4x/read_jsonl 1.7x, to_datetime 4.5x, to_numeric

### 2026-07-01 BlackThrush — astype(Int64) on a Utf8 column: 0.65x LOSS -> 4.1x WIN (typed parse path; sister of the Utf8->Float64 lever)
The documented follow-up to the Utf8->Float64 astype fix: `Series.astype(Int64)` on a string column was also a LOSS
(1M int-strings: fp 63.6ms vs pandas 41.3ms = 0.65x) — same cause (Column::astype had no Utf8->numeric typed path, so it
fell to the generic per-cell cast_scalar Scalar tail). FIX: a typed Utf8->Int64 path reproducing cast_scalar(Utf8(s),
Int64) EXACTLY — try `s.parse::<i64>()`; else `s.parse::<f64>()` accepted only when finite, integer-valued (fract==0),
and in i64 range (fp's long-standing "1.0"->1 via-float-intermediate behavior); else raise — parsed straight from the
contiguous buffer into a typed Vec<i64>, then from_i64_values_owned (MOVE). Bail to the generic path on any failed cell
(reproduces the identical InvalidCast). Bit-identical to the prior generic path (FP-P2D-024's 13 fixtures incl.
utf8_to_int stay green).

FLIPS LOSS->WIN. fp-columnar 467/0. NOTE: fp accepts "1.0"->1 where pandas astype('int64') RAISES — this is a
PRE-EXISTING cast_scalar parity difference (the generic path does the same), NOT introduced here; the typed path is
bit-identical to prior fp behavior. Utf8->Float64 (shipped e9382ba79) + Utf8->Int64 now both typed — the Utf8->numeric
astype surface is covered.

### 2026-07-01 BlackThrush — searchsorted(many needles) on a sorted Int64 column: 0.49x LOSS -> 1.21x WIN (typed primitive binary search)
Re-survey found `Series.searchsorted(values, side)` a LOSS (2M i64 needles into a 2M sorted i64 array: fp 926ms vs
pandas 450ms = 0.49x — 463ns/search, far above a binary search's ~50ns floor). CAUSE: `searchsorted_values` binary-
searches via `vals.partition_point(|v| compare_scalar_values(v, value))` over a materialized `Vec<Scalar>` — ~42M
Scalar-enum comparisons (21 steps × 2M needles), each paying enum-dispatch instead of a raw i64 compare.

FIX: a typed fast path — when the column is all-valid Int64 (`as_i64_slice`) AND ascending-sorted AND every needle is
Int64, binary-search the raw `&[i64]` with primitive `partition_point(x < k)` [left] / `(x <= k)` [right]. Mixed / float
/ missing needles keep the general Scalar path (cross-type compare + missing handled exactly). Bit-identical: for an
all-valid sorted i64 array `compare_scalar_values(Int64,Int64)` is i64 cmp, so the insertion site matches. Verified vs
pandas 2.2.3 (sorted-with-duplicates array [1,3,3,3,5,7,7,9], needles incl. boundary/out-of-range/exact-match — left AND
right both EXACT).

FLIPS LOSS->WIN. fp-frame lib 3109/0; conformance 1596 packets green. (Float64 sorted column + Float64 needles has the
same Scalar-dispatch shape — a natural sibling, not landed this session.) Also confirmed dominant this survey (no gap):
map(dict) 2.2x, df.replace(dict) 14.6x, str.extract 3.1x, astype(datetime) parity; astype(Utf8->Bool) is a correctness
parity item (fp raises, pandas gives all-True), not perf.

### 2026-07-01 BlackThrush — searchsorted(many needles) on a sorted Float64 column: 0.55x LOSS -> 1.19x WIN (typed primitive binary search, f64 sibling)
The documented follow-up to the Int64 searchsorted fix: `Series.searchsorted(f64_needles)` into a sorted Float64 array
was also a LOSS (2M f64 needles into 2M sorted f64: fp 1030ms vs pandas 562ms = 0.55x) — same cause (per-step
compare_scalar_values dispatch over a materialized Vec<Scalar>). FIX: the f64 sibling — when the column is all-valid
Float64 (as_f64_slice) AND ascending-sorted AND every needle is a non-NaN Float64, binary-search the raw &[f64] with
primitive `partition_point(x < k)` [left] / `(x <= k)` [right]. compare_scalar_values orders Float64 via
`partial_cmp().unwrap_or(Equal)`, which for a no-NaN column + non-NaN needles is EXACTLY primitive `<`/`<=` (incl.
-0.0 == 0.0, which partial_cmp treats equal); a NaN/non-Float64 needle OR a stray present-NaN (which fails the `windows`
sorted check) keeps the general path. Bit-identical. Verified vs pandas 2.2.3 ([1,3,3,3,5.5,7,7,9], needles incl.
dups/boundary/OOR/-0.0/exact — left AND right EXACT).

### 2026-07-01 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy.pct_change: 0.75x LOSS (low card) -> 53.9x WIN (dense typed path, sister to grouped diff)
Groupby-methods survey found `gb.pct_change` a LOSS at low cardinality (2M, card=100: fp 468.8ms vs pandas 351.3ms =
0.75x) and slow everywhere (~400-600ms, 56x slower than the dense grouped cumsum at 7ms) — because it went STRAIGHT to
the generic `transform_groups` per-group Scalar gather + `forward_fill_scalars` materialization, while gb.diff/cumsum
have dense typed paths. (Other gb methods dominate: cumcount 5.8x, rank 7.5x, cumsum 7x.)

FIX: `dense_groupby_pct_change_f64{,_by_key}` — sister of the grouped-diff kernels but emitting `(v - prev)/prev` with a
`prev.abs() < f64::EPSILON -> invalid(NaN)` guard, in one sequential pass over the raw &[f64] with a per-group ring
buffer keyed by the dense int64 offset (or gid). Wired for positive `periods` + all-valid no-NaN Float64 value + dense
key; negative/zero periods and any missing/NaN keep the general path. Bit-identical to the generic transform for a clean
column: pandas' default `fill_method='ffill'` is a no-op with nothing missing, the EPSILON guard matches, and a set
validity bit always carries a non-NaN result. Verified vs pandas 2.2.3 (multi-row groups, periods 1 AND 2 EXACT).

bench 2M Float64 value, i64 key, best-of-6, pandas 2.2.3:

| `gb.pct_change` card=100000 | 607.9ms | 10.3ms | 59x | 0.13x -> 462x WIN (pandas 4733ms) |

FLIPS LOSS->WIN (was fragile near-parity: 0.75x at card=100). fp-frame lib 3109/0; conformance 1596 packets green.
NOTE: fp gives NaN where pandas gives inf for a prev==0 divisor — a PRE-EXISTING generic-path parity difference (the
EPSILON guard predates this change), NOT introduced here; the dense path reproduces it exactly.

### 2026-07-01 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy.shift on a NULLABLE Float64 column: 0.053x LOSS (18.8x slower) -> 1.28x WIN (nullable dense path)
Nullable-value groupby-transform survey (20%-null f64, 2M) found gb.shift a CATASTROPHIC loss (card=100: fp 295ms vs
pandas 15.7ms = 0.053x, 18.8x slower) — the dense `dense_groupby_shift_f64_by_key` fast path gates on `as_f64_slice`
(no-missing), so a column WITH nulls fell to the generic per-group Scalar gather. (gb.ffill/bfill are also losses on
nullable — 0.53x — same generic path; separate follow-up, different fill semantics.)

FIX: `dense_groupby_shift_nullable_f64{,_by_key}` — shift the raw &[f64] + validity `periods` rows back within each group
via a per-group ring buffer carrying (datum, valid), CARRYING the source's missing-ness (a shifted-in first-`periods`
position is missing; a shifted value that was itself missing stays missing). Wired for positive periods + Float64 (via
as_f64_slice_with_validity, which the all-valid path's as_f64_slice gate misses) + dense key. Bit-identical to the
generic `vals[src].clone()` shift for a Float64 column (present source → its datum; missing source → missing; valid
slots non-NaN by construction). Verified vs pandas 2.2.3 (nullable groups, periods 1 AND 2 EXACT).

bench 2M Float64 20%-null value, i64 key, best-of-6, pandas 2.2.3:

FLIPS a 18.8x LOSS -> WIN. fp-frame lib 3109/0; conformance 1596 packets green. OPEN (same category, next lever):
gb.ffill/bfill on nullable f64 (0.53x) — need forward/backward-fill dense kernels carrying validity.

### 2026-07-01 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy.ffill/bfill on nullable Float64: 0.53x LOSS -> 9.2x/9.9x WIN (nullable dense fill kernels)
The documented follow-up to the grouped-shift nullable fix: gb.ffill/bfill on a nullable Float64 column were LOSSES (2M
20%-null f64, card=100: ffill fp 283ms vs pandas 149ms = 0.53x; bfill 299ms vs 159ms = 0.53x) — both on the generic
`transform_groups` per-group Scalar gather. FIX: `dense_groupby_fill_nullable_f64{,_by_key}` (one `forward` flag selects
ffill ascending / bfill descending) — per group, carry the last present datum + a `consecutive_fills` counter over the
raw &[f64] + validity, filling a missing slot unless > `limit` consecutive fills. A shared `try_dense_fill(limit,
forward)` gates both on a Float64 value + dense key. Bit-identical to the generic path (filled slot = last present
datum; present slot = its datum; unfilled gap stays missing; the `consecutive_fills` reset-on-present / increment-on-gap
logic matches, incl. `limit`). Verified vs pandas 2.2.3 (ffill/bfill + ffill(limit=1); leading/trailing gaps EXACT).

| `gb.bfill` card=100 | 298.8ms | 16.2ms | 18.5x | 0.53x -> 9.9x WIN (pandas 159ms) |

Both FLIP LOSS->WIN. With grouped shift (07ab7a033), the nullable-f64 SeriesGroupBy transform surface (shift/ffill/bfill)
is now dense. fp-frame lib 3109/0; conformance 1596 packets green.

### 2026-07-01 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy.diff/cumsum/cumprod/cummin/cummax on nullable Float64: 0.06x LOSS -> 1.9-2.1x WIN (nullable dense kernels)
Completing the nullable-f64 SeriesGroupBy transform sweep (after shift/ffill/bfill): diff + the four cum* were ALL
catastrophic losses on a nullable value column (2M 20%-null f64, card=100: diff 307ms/0.058x, cumsum 314ms/0.071x,
cummax 305ms/0.067x — ~15-17x slower than pandas) — their dense paths (`try_cum_dense`, `dense_groupby_diff_f64`) gate
on `as_f64_slice` (no missing), so nullable fell to the generic per-group Scalar gather.

FIX: (1) `try_cum_dense_nullable(init, step)` — skipna cumulative over &[f64]+validity (present slot folds acc=step(acc,v)
and outputs it; missing slot outputs missing, acc untouched; a present slot whose acc goes NaN via cumprod inf*0 clears
its bit), wired into cumsum/cumprod/cummin/cummax after the all-valid path. (2) `dense_groupby_diff_nullable_f64{,_by_key}`
— positional NaN-propagating diff (out = v - v_{periods-back}, valid iff both endpoints present). Bit-identical to the
generic paths (verified vs pandas 2.2.3: diff/cumsum/cumprod/cummin/cummax on nullable groups ALL EXACT, incl. the
skipna running-accumulator-across-gaps semantics).

bench 2M Float64 20%-null value, i64 key, best-of-6, pandas 2.2.3:

diff removes a 17x-slower defect (parity/win); cum* FLIP to WIN. The full nullable-f64 SeriesGroupBy transform surface
(shift, ffill, bfill, diff, cumsum, cumprod, cummin, cummax) is now dense. fp-frame lib 3109/0; conformance 1596 green.

### 2026-07-01 BlackThrush — DataFrameGroupBy shift/diff/cumsum/cumprod/cummin/cummax on nullable Float64 cols: 0.04-0.11x LOSS -> 0.8-1.35x (10-15x fp-side)
Parallel to the SeriesGroupBy nullable sweep: DataFrameGroupBy transforms were catastrophic losses when ANY value column
was nullable (2M×2 f64 20%-null, card=100: dfgb.shift 566ms/0.083x, cumsum 566ms/0.051x, diff 606ms/0.11x — 9-26x slower
than pandas). CAUSE: `try_shift_dense`/`try_diff_dense`/`try_cum_dense` did `col.as_f64_slice()?` per column, so a single
nullable column bailed the WHOLE frame to the generic per-column Scalar `transform_groups`.

FIX: each helper now handles a nullable Float64 column per-column via `as_f64_slice_with_validity` + the gid-based
nullable kernels (`dense_groupby_shift_nullable_f64`, `dense_groupby_diff_nullable_f64`, new
`dense_groupby_cum_nullable_f64`); all-valid columns keep the MOVE fast path, non-Float64 columns still bail to generic.
Bit-identical (verified vs pandas 2.2.3: shift/cumsum/diff/cumprod on a nullable-col frame ALL EXACT).

bench 2M×2 Float64 20%-null cols, i64 key, best-of-6, pandas 2.2.3:

| `dfgb.shift` card=100  | 566ms | 54.2ms | 10.4x | 0.083x -> 0.87x (pandas 47.3ms) |

diff FLIPS to WIN; shift/cumsum go from catastrophic loss to near-parity (removes a 10-26x-slower defect; residual is the
DataFrame multi-column + gid_per_row build vs pandas' fused Cython — a smaller follow-up, e.g. a by-key path avoiding
gid_per_row). fp-frame lib 3109/0; conformance 1596 packets green.

### 2026-07-01 BlackThrush — Series.shift (non-groupby) on nullable Float64: 0.091x LOSS (11x slower) -> 1.01x parity
Probing plain (non-groupby) Series transforms on a nullable column found `Series.shift` a CATASTROPHIC loss (5M
20%-null f64: fp 440ms vs pandas 40ms = 0.091x, 11x slower). The all-valid `as_f64_slice` fast path bails on any
missing, so a nullable Float64 column fell to the generic `self.column.values()` Scalar materialization + rebuild.
(Series.diff already had a nullable typed path at 0.49x — its residual 2x is per-bit validity, a micro-opt, not touched;
cumsum/cummax already WIN 2.2x/2.3x.)

FIX: a nullable Float64 fast path in `shift_with_fill_value` — a validity-carrying memmove over the raw &[f64] +
validity: carry `data[src]` + `validity[src]` into each shifted position, write the (datum, valid) `fill` into vacated
ones. Handles a present-numeric or missing fill; a non-numeric non-missing fill keeps the generic path. Bit-identical to
the generic `vals[src].clone()` shift for a Float64 column. Verified vs pandas 2.2.3 (shift(2)/shift(-2)/shift(1,fill=0)/
shift(10) on a nullable Series — ALL EXACT, incl. missing-carry, negative periods, valued fill, periods>n).

### 2026-07-01 BlackThrush — Series.cumprod (non-groupby) on nullable Float64: 0.103x LOSS (9.7x slower) -> 1.35x WIN
Odd asymmetry: non-groupby Series cumsum/cummin/cummax on a nullable f64 column WIN (2.0-2.3x) but `cumprod` was a
LOSS (2M 20%-null: fp 165ms vs pandas 17ms = 0.103x, 9.7x slower). CAUSE: cumsum has a nullable Float64 typed path
(s2i37) but cumprod, cummin, cummax only had all-valid Int64/Float64 paths — a nullable f64 column fell to cumprod's
generic `.values()` Scalar loop. FIX: added the nullable Float64 fast path to cumprod (skipna prefix product over
&[f64]+validity; present multiplies acc and outputs it, missing outputs missing without advancing acc). Crucially, since
cumprod's acc can overflow to inf then a present 0.0 gives `inf*0 = NaN`, the bit is cleared when acc goes NaN — matching
the generic `Float64(NaN)`->from_values->missing. Bit-identical, verified vs pandas 2.2.3 (missing-skip AND the
inf/NaN overflow tail EXACT: [1e200, inf, NaN, NaN]).

OPEN (surfaced, next lever): NON-groupby whole-DataFrame df.shift/df.diff/df.cumsum on nullable f64 cols are LOSSES
(2M×3: 0.12x/0.16x/0.45x) — the DataFrame-level per-column path materializes Scalars; needs per-column typed dispatch to
the nullable kernels (df.shift -> the Series nullable shift path; df.diff/cumsum -> nullable typed).

### 2026-07-01 BlackThrush — BLOCKER SURFACED: DataFrame nullable numeric-column transforms slow (0.12-0.45x) — Column::clone de-types via a deliberate NullKind-preserving invariant
Non-groupby whole-DataFrame df.shift/diff/cumsum/cumprod on nullable Float64 columns are LOSSES (2M×3, vs pandas 2.2.3):
df.shift 245ms/0.119x, df.diff 253ms/0.155x, df.cumsum 235ms/0.449x (the Series-level ops are ALL fast — the DataFrame
path is the overhead).

ROOT CAUSE (pinned): `DataFrame` transforms go through `apply_per_column` -> `column_as_series` which does
`col.clone()`. `Column::clone` sets `data: None`, DROPPING the cached `ColumnData::Float64` Arc buffer. A nullable
Float64 column from `from_values` carries its typed-ness in `self.data` (with `values: Eager`), NOT in a lazy `values`
variant — so after clone `as_f64_slice_with_validity` returns None and the per-column Series op falls to the generic
per-element Scalar path (~10x). Verified: orig column `as_f64_slice_with_validity` Some=true, its `.clone()` Some=false.

WHY NOT A SIMPLE FIX (attempted + REVERTED): carrying the Arc-backed `data` through clone (cheap bump) DID fix it
(df.cumsum 0.449x -> 2.79x WIN, df.shift/diff 6x fp-side) BUT broke 3 fp-columnar unit tests that pin the intended
invariant: clone drops `data`, and `clone_dense_values_from_cache` keeps NULLABLE columns EAGER on purpose — to preserve
the distinction between `Null(NullKind::NaN)` and `Null(NullKind::Null)` (and NaT), which the only nullable typed backing
(`LazyNullableFloat64`, carrying just (f64 data, validity)) would COLLAPSE. So a nullable Float64 column genuinely cannot
be represented typed without losing NullKind. Reverted (fp-columnar 467/0 restored).

SAFE FIX DIRECTION (next session, not landed): give the DataFrame transforms a DIRECT-column-access path that reads
`self.columns[name].as_f64_slice_with_validity()` on the STORED (still-typed) column and runs the kernel WITHOUT the
de-typing `column_as_series` clone. Safe for cum*/diff (their generic path already NORMALIZES every missing to
`Null(NullKind::NaN)`, so a typed output matches bit-for-bit); shift is the exception (it CARRIES the source NullKind via
`vals[src].clone()`, so a typed shift would need to preserve NullKind — or accept the Float64-missing==NaN convention).
Alternatively: a NullKind-preserving nullable typed backing. Series-level ops are unaffected (already fast).

### 2026-07-01 BlackThrush — DataFrame cumsum/cumprod/cummin/cummax/diff on nullable Float64 cols: 0.16x/0.45x LOSS -> 2.3x/9x WIN (direct-column-access, the safe fix for the surfaced clone blocker)
Landed the SAFE fix for the blocker surfaced above (Column::clone de-types nullable Float64 via the NullKind-preserving
invariant): instead of touching clone, the DataFrame cum*/diff now fold straight off the STORED column's typed
`(&[f64], &ValidityMask)` (via `as_f64_slice_with_validity`) — no `column_as_series` clone, no de-typing. `apply_cum_f64`
runs the skipna cumulative for Float64 columns (present folds `acc=step(acc,v)`, missing outputs missing, cumprod inf*0
NaN clears its bit); `df.diff` runs the positional NaN-propagating diff (valid iff both endpoints present). Non-Float64
columns delegate to the Series op / pass through EXACTLY as `apply_per_column`'s gate did (numeric → op, non-numeric →
clone passthrough — preserves the string-column-passthrough test + Timedelta/Bool dtype rules). SAFE because cum*/diff
NORMALIZE every missing to `Null(NaN)` in both the typed and generic paths (unlike shift, which carries source NullKind —
deliberately left on the existing path). Bit-identical, verified vs pandas 2.2.3 (cumsum/cumprod/cummin/cummax + diff
±periods on nullable cols ALL EXACT).

Completes the non-groupby DataFrame transform sweep (after cum*/diff, d514cac48). df.shift on nullable Float64 cols was
a LOSS (2M×3: fp 245ms vs pandas 25.6ms = 0.119x) — same `column_as_series` clone de-typing. FIX: Float64 columns shift
straight off the STORED column's `(&[f64], &ValidityMask)` (validity-carrying memmove; vacated = missing/Null(NaN)); the
NullKind concern is moot because a typed Float64 column's missing slots ARE Null(NaN) (the convention Series::shift
relies on, conformance-green), and the generic path's de-typed clone carries those same Null(NaN) — so carrying
`data[src]`+`validity[src]` reproduces `vals[src].clone()` bit-for-bit. Non-Float64 columns keep the exact
apply_per_column gate (numeric → Series shift, non-numeric → clone passthrough). Verified vs pandas 2.2.3

`try_shift_dense`/`try_diff_dense` always called `transform_dense_gids()`, building+reading an n-element `gid_per_row`
Vec. FIX: a by-key fast path for a SINGLE bounded-Int64 key — index each per-group ring by the key's dense offset
`(key-min)` DIRECTLY (reusing the SeriesGroupBy `dense_groupby_{shift,diff}{,_nullable}_f64_by_key` kernels), skipping
`gid_per_row` entirely; multi-key / non-bounded keys keep the gid layout. Bit-identical (verified vs pandas 2.2.3:

n-element `gid_per_row` Vec via `transform_dense_gids`. FIX: a by-key fast path (sister of the shift/diff by-key) — a
single bounded-Int64 key folds each per-group accumulator by the key's dense offset `(key-min)` directly (nullable via
the new `dense_groupby_cum_nullable_f64_by_key`, all-valid via the inline fold + `build` MOVE), skipping gid_per_row;
multi-key / non-bounded keys keep the gid layout. Bit-identical (verified vs pandas 2.2.3: grouped cumsum on a nullable

bfill/pct_change) is now dense AND by-key where a single bounded-Int64 key applies.

### 2026-07-01 BlackThrush — Series.sort_values on nullable Float64: 0.27x LOSS (3.6x slower) -> 1.25x WIN (typed present-subset argsort)
Fresh-area probe found sort_values on a nullable Float64 column a big LOSS (2M 20%-null: fp 1118ms vs pandas 307ms =
0.27x). The typed radix path gates on all-valid (`as_i64_slice`/`as_f64_slice`), so a nullable column fell to the
O(n log n) generic comparator (`compare_scalars_with_na_position` over per-position `self.values()` Scalar boxes). FIX:
a nullable Float64 path — partition present/missing off `(&[f64], &ValidityMask)`, gather present values into a Column
and argsort them via the fast typed `Column::argsort_with` (comparison-free radix / stable), then place the missing
block at `na_position`. Bit-identical to the generic sort INCLUDING the output index order (verified vs pandas 2.2.3:
asc/desc × na_first/na_last with duplicate + missing values — idx AND vals EXACT; descending preserves ties in original
order too, matching the stable comparator).

Follow-up from the sort_values probe: Float64 had NO typed drop_duplicates path (Int64/Datetime64/Timedelta64/Utf8 do),
so both all-valid AND nullable f64 fell to the generic `.values()` Scalar + `scalar_key_allow_missing` path (nullable was
0.63x pandas). FIX: a typed Float64 dedup keying present values by their normalized f64 bits (-0.0 == 0.0, matching
scalar_key_allow_missing) in an FxHashMap<u64>, collapsing all missing/NaN into one group via a `seen_missing` flag
(pandas dedups all NaN together, keeping one; a typed Float64 column's missing are Null(NaN) — the distinct-NullKind case
is object/Null-dtype, which doesn't hit this DType::Float64-gated path). First/Last/None all handled; typed
`take_positions` gather. Bit-identical, verified vs pandas 2.2.3 (idx AND vals EXACT incl. NaN-dedup + -0.0/0.0 merge).

Removes the Scalar-materialization tax; lands at NEAR PARITY (0.88-0.94x — residual is FxHashMap<u64> vs pandas' khash
constant factor, a structural hash-table difference). Real fp-side gain (not near-zero), bit-identical, covers the whole

### 2026-07-01 BlackThrush — Series.quantile on nullable Float64: 0.40x LOSS (2.5x slower) -> 1.65x WIN (nullable quickselect)
Probe found quantile(q) on a nullable Float64 column a LOSS (2M 20%-null: fp 55ms vs pandas 22ms = 0.40x) — striking
because median (== quantile 0.5) was a 1.15x WIN. Cause: quantile's all-valid typed quickselect (`typed_quantile_f64`)
gates on `as_f64_slice`/`as_i64_slice`, so a nullable column fell to the generic filter + O(n log n) FULL SORT +
percentile_with_interpolation. FIX: a nullable Float64 path — gather present (`validity.get(i) && !data[i].is_nan()` ==
the generic `!is_missing()`) values off `(&[f64], &ValidityMask)` and run the same O(n) `typed_quantile_f64` quickselect.
Bit-identical (typed_quantile_f64 mirrors sort+percentile; verified vs pandas 2.2.3: q=0/0.25/0.5/0.75/1.0 on a nullable
series ALL EXACT = 1/2/3/4/5).

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy.ffill/bfill on Int64 & Utf8: gather-index dense path (Utf8 0.25x -> 1.23x WIN)
Probe found grouped `ffill`/`bfill` a LOSS for every dtype except Float64: the dense `try_dense_fill` only covers f64,
so an Int64/Utf8/Bool value column fell to the generic `transform_groups` path — SipHash/dense group build + a per-group
`Vec<Scalar>` clone + a scatter clone + `from_values` rescan, ALL of it String churn for Utf8 (grouped Utf8 ffill was ~4x
slower than pandas). KEY INSIGHT: grouped fill is a pure GATHER — every output row copies exactly one source row's value.
Added `try_dense_fill_gather` (dtype-generic): ONE O(n) pass over a dense gid layout computes, per output slot, the source
row it copies — `row` itself when present (or when no in-limit fill is available, keeping its own missing value), else the
group's last-seen present row (ffill) / next present row (bfill); `Column::take_positions` then does the typed gather
(contiguous Int64/Utf8 buffers, no per-group Scalar materialization). Gated to dtypes whose missingness is fully
determined by the validity mask (Bool/BoolNullable/Int64/Int64Nullable/Utf8) so `validity.get(i)` == `!is_missing()`;
Float64 (NaN-as-missing, own path) and Datetime64/Timedelta64 (NaT sentinels) excluded. Bit-identical (present slot copies
own value, filled slot copies the same source row the generic path clones, unfilled-missing copies own missing value;
`limit` caps consecutive fills identically). Verified vs pandas 2.2.3: ffill+bfill, Int64/Utf8/Bool, limit=None/1/2/3,
leading/trailing nulls and all-null groups — ALL EXACT (4000-row differential, 0 diffs across 9 cases). bfill shares the
identical machinery (reverse iteration).

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy.shift(periods) on Int64: dense ring kernel (0.18x -> 5.4x WIN, all-valid)
Probe found grouped `shift` a big LOSS for Int64 (the Float64 dense `shift` paths — `dense_groupby_shift{,_nullable}_f64{,_by_key}` — had no Int64 sibling, so an Int64 value column fell to the generic `transform_groups` per-group `Vec<Scalar>` clone + scatter + `from_values` rescan). A grouped shift is a within-group POSITIONAL lag; added `dense_groupby_shift_nullable_i64{,_by_key}` — EXACT structural mirrors of the proven f64 ring kernels: ONE sequential pass carrying each group's last `periods` present values through a per-key (dense i64-key histogram offset) or per-gid ring, so output row `r` copies the `periods`-back value in its group (missing at a group head or when that source slot was missing). Only `periods >= 1` (pandas forward shift; negative/zero fall to generic). Gated to `DType::Int64` (`as_i64_slice_with_validity`). Bit-identical to the generic Scalar shift in VALUES + VALIDITY — verified vs a public-API reimplementation of the exact generic path (5000-row differential, ffill/negative also covered): every value + validity bit identical; the only delta is at group-head missing slots, where the typed backing emits `missing_for_dtype(Int64)` = `Null(Null)` (the canonical Int64 missing every typed Int64 path — take/dedup/... — emits) while the generic `vec![Null(NaN)]` initializer left a NON-canonical `Null(NaN)` there (same `is_missing()`, same validity). Full fp-frame suite 3109/0 confirms no golden pins the NaN kind.

FLIPS LOSS->WIN. The CSR-scatter first attempt (per-group appearance-order layout + gather) was REJECTED — cache-hostile scatter made it 0.22x (93ms); the sequential ring kernel (mirroring f64) is 10x tighter. FOLLOW-UP: a nullable Int64 column sourced THROUGH a DataFrame drops its `data: ColumnData::Int64` backing so `as_i64_slice_with_validity` returns None and it stays generic (a raw nullable column engages the fast path fine) — separate backing-preservation fix; also Utf8 grouped shift stays generic (nullable Utf8 is eager Vec<Scalar>, String-clone-bound vs pandas object-pointer copy — structural).

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — Column::clone dropped the nullable-Int64 typed backing (broad: gb.shift nullable 0.06x -> 1.44x)
Diagnosing why nullable Int64 grouped shift stayed generic (328ms) while all-valid flipped to a 5.4x WIN (2673d56cc), found the root cause in `Column::clone`: it sets `data: None` and rebuilds `values` via `clone_dense_values_from_cache`, which rescues the ALL-VALID case (Eager -> lazy typed backing) but BAILS for any column with nulls (`count_valid != len`). So a NULLABLE Int64 column (Eager `values` + `Arc<[i64]>` `data` cache) lost its typed slice on EVERY clone — and since Series/DataFrame ops clone columns constantly, `as_i64_slice_with_validity` returned None on the clone, silently degrading every dense fast path gated on it (groupby shift/dedup/value_counts/joins) to the generic Scalar path. FIX: carry the `Arc<[i64]>` cache through the clone (O(1) refcount bump) for a nullable Int64 column whose values stay Eager. SCOPED narrowly: all-valid clones (values already typed, tests assert data=None) and Float64 (mixed NaN/Null missing would canonicalize `Null(Null)`->`Null(NaN)` under a typed view) are excluded. Bit-identical by construction — `values`/`validity`/`dtype` unchanged, cache is a consistent view (`PartialEq` ignores `data`). fp-columnar 467/0, fp-frame 3109/0, fp-conformance 418/1 (the 1 failure — `prop_series_where_and_mask_series_are_condition_duals` — is PRE-EXISTING: reproduces identically at pre-session commit 443279885 and with this change reverted; a latent where/mask NaN/Null duality bug UNRELATED to this change, filed separately).

Broad structural fix: re-enables the typed Int64 path on ALL cloned nullable Int64 columns (shift measured here; dedup/value_counts/joins/groupby all gate on `as_i64_slice`/`as_i64_slice_with_validity`). REJECTED first attempt: a blanket carry of Int64/Float64/Bool caches broke 3 fp-columnar unit tests (they assert `data: None` after clone for all-valid + Float64 shapes) and risked the Float64 canonicalization — the narrow Int64-Eager scope is the safe subset.

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy.diff(periods) on Int64: dense i64->f64 ring kernel (0.31x -> 4.4x WIN)
Sister to the Int64 shift win: grouped `diff` on an Int64 column produces a FLOAT64 output (`cur.to_f64() - prev.to_f64()`, exactly what the generic branch and pandas both do — pandas returns float64 for int diff). The dense f64 diff kernels gate on `as_f64_slice*` (Float64 only), so an Int64 column fell to the generic per-group Scalar gather (~9x slower than pandas). Added `dense_groupby_diff_i64_to_f64{,_by_key}` — the diff ring kernels reading i64 and casting to f64 (ring stores the cast value so the subtract is a plain f64 op). UNLIKE shift, NO NullKind subtlety: a Float64 output's missing IS `Null(NaN)` = `missing_for_dtype(Float64)`, exactly the generic path's `Null(NaN)`. Gated to `as_i64_slice_with_validity` (DType::Int64; excludes the Bool-XOR and Timedelta-diff special cases, which aren't Int64). Bit-identical — verified vs a public-API reimplementation of the exact generic path (5000-row differential, all-valid + nullable, periods 1/2/3/7, dtype Float64, 0 diffs). fp-frame 3109/0, fp-conformance 418/1 (pre-existing where/mask failure only).

| `gb.diff(1)` Int64 nullable  | (generic) | 18.3ms | 3.1x WIN (pandas 57ms) |

FLIPS LOSS->WIN. The nullable case rides on the Column::clone backing-preservation fix (41a17e11d) — without it the DataFrame-sourced nullable Int64 column would have stayed generic. Completes the grouped Int64 transform vein (shift + diff done; ffill/bfill done earlier).

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy sum/mean/max/min on NULLABLE numeric value: dense skipna bucket (0.32x -> 1.5x WIN)
Probe found grouped reductions on a nullable Int64 value column ~0.3x pandas: `agg_numeric` (shared by sum/mean/max/min/etc.) has dense direct-address bucket paths, but they gate on `as_f64_slice`/`as_i64_slice` (ALL-VALID), so a nullable value column fell to the generic `build_groups` Scalar path (per-row .values() + ScalarKey + SipHash). Added a NULLABLE branch to the bounded-Int64-key dense path: bucket only PRESENT values per group (skipna — `validity.get(i)`, plus a valid-but-NaN Float64 slot skipped, exactly the generic `filter_map` that skips `is_missing()`), and emit `Null(NaN)` for an all-missing group (the generic `nums.is_empty()` arm) else `Float64(func(nums))`. Bit-identical to the generic path (same first-seen gid order + i64 labels, same present nums per group in row order, same aggregate). Verified vs pandas 2.2.3 (sum via min_count=1 to match fp's empty-group NaN; mean/max/min natural): sum/mean/max/min ALL EXACT incl. an all-missing group. One branch fixes every `agg_numeric` reducer. fp-frame 3109/0, fp-conformance 418/1 (pre-existing where/mask only).

FLIPS LOSS->WIN across the reduction surface. FOLLOW-UPS (this probe): sparse/wide-i64-key + Utf8-key nullable value still generic (same branch, not yet added); `sgb.count` nullable 0.44x (separate count path); Series.diff nullable-i64 typed path attempted but REJECTED — 117ms->11ms fp-side yet still 0.1x (pandas non-grouped diff is a 1.15ms bandwidth-optimal SIMD subtract, unwinnable).

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — Series.cumsum on NULLABLE Int64: typed skipna prefix-sum (0.14x -> 1.97x WIN)
Follow-up from the nullable-i64 probe: Series.cumsum on a nullable Int64 column was 0.14x pandas (122ms) — the all-valid `as_i64_slice` cumsum path bails on ANY missing and the nullable-Float64 path is Float64-only, so it fell to the generic per-row `.values()` Scalar loop. The generic loop emits, for a nullable Int64 column, `acc += val.to_f64()` -> `Float64(acc)` on a present row and `Null(NaN)` on a missing row (skipna, acc not advanced) — a FLOAT64 output (pandas cumsum on int-with-NaN is float64 too). Added a typed path running that same skipna prefix sum off the raw `(&[i64], &ValidityMask)`, casting each present datum to f64 (mirror of the existing nullable-Float64 cumsum path). Bit-identical — missing slot -> `missing_for_dtype(Float64)` == `Null(NaN)` (the generic `Null(NaN)`), present slot `Float64(acc)` where `acc += data[i] as f64` (the generic `val.to_f64()`), seeded 0.0. Verified vs pandas 2.2.3 (5000-row, leading + interior missing, dtype Float64, 0 diffs). fp-frame 3109/0, fp-conformance 418/1 (pre-existing where/mask only).

| `Series.cumsum` nullable-i64 | 122ms | 8.5ms | 0.14x -> 1.97x WIN (pandas 16.8ms) |

FLIPS LOSS->WIN. Prefix-sum's sequential dependency means pandas isn't bandwidth-trivial (unlike the REJECTED non-grouped diff), so the typed pass wins. cumprod/cummax/cummin nullable-i64 are the sibling follow-ups (same all-valid-gate gap).

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — Series.cummax/cummin on NULLABLE Int64: typed skipna running-extreme (0.28x -> 3.5-3.9x WIN)
Siblings of the nullable-Int64 cumsum win: cummax/cummin on a nullable Int64 column fell to the generic per-row `.values()` Scalar loop (all-valid `as_i64_slice` bails on missing; the nullable path is Float64-only). The generic fallback runs the skipna running max/min over `val.to_f64()` and emits a FLOAT64 column (present -> `Float64(acc)`, missing -> `Null(NaN)`; pandas cummax/cummin on int-with-NaN is float64 too). Added typed paths running the same running extreme off the raw `(&[i64], &ValidityMask)` cast to f64 (mirror of the existing nullable-Float64 paths). Bit-identical: the f64 compare over `data[i] as f64` matches the generic `to_f64()` compare exactly (any i64->f64 precision loss is identical on both sides), missing slots materialize `Null(NaN)`, seeded +/-inf. Verified vs pandas 2.2.3 (5000-row, leading + interior missing, dtype Float64, 0 diffs). fp-frame 3109/0, fp-conformance 418/1 (pre-existing where/mask only).

FLIPS LOSS->WIN. Completes the nullable-Int64 cumulative surface except cumprod (deferred — inf*0->NaN overflow bit-clear needs the acc.is_nan() guard the nullable-f64 cumprod path carries).

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — Series.cumprod on NULLABLE Int64: typed skipna running-product (0.27x -> 2.7x WIN)
Completes the nullable-Int64 cumulative surface (cumsum/cummax/cummin already done). cumprod on a nullable Int64 column fell to the generic per-row `.values()` Scalar loop (all-valid `as_i64_slice` bails on missing; nullable path Float64-only). The generic fallback runs the skipna running product over `val.to_f64()` and emits a FLOAT64 column (present -> `Float64(acc)`, missing -> `Null(NaN)`; pandas cumprod on int-with-NaN is float64). Added a typed path off the raw `(&[i64], &ValidityMask)` cast to f64 — mirror of the nullable-Float64 cumprod path INCLUDING its `acc.is_nan()` bit-clear (a running acc that overflows to `inf` then hits a 0 gives `inf*0 == NaN`, which must materialize missing). Bit-identical: `acc *= data[i] as f64` matches the generic `to_f64()` product exactly, seeded 1.0. Verified BIT-EXACT vs pandas 2.2.3 (raw f64 bit-pattern compare): case A (5000-row random 0..12 nullable — overflow to inf, present-0 -> 0) and case B (crafted 400x900 overflow-to-inf, then a present 0 -> inf*0=NaN propagating) BOTH 0 diffs. fp-frame 3109/0, fp-conformance 418/1 (pre-existing where/mask only).

FLIPS LOSS->WIN. nullable-Int64 CUMULATIVE surface now COMPLETE (cumsum 1.97x / cummax 3.5x / cummin 3.9x / cumprod 2.7x). All four: the all-valid typed path gated on `as_i64_slice` (no missing) with a Float64-only nullable sibling — the i64-with-validity path was the missing rung.

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy sum/mean/max/min NULLABLE value + contiguous-Utf8 (categorical) key: dense skipna bucket (0.59x -> 1.4x WIN)
Extends the nullable agg_numeric skipna-bucket fix to the CONTIGUOUS-Utf8 key path (the categorical `df.groupby("cat").sum()` shape). agg_numeric's Utf8-contiguous dense path gated its value bucket on `as_f64_slice`/`as_i64_slice` (all-valid), so a nullable value column keyed by a contiguous Utf8 column fell to generic build_groups (~0.6x pandas). Added the sister nullable branch (bucket present values only — skipna, `Null(NaN)` for all-missing group, else `Float64(func(nums))`). Bit-identical to the generic path — VERIFIED with the branch actually exercised (the key gathered to a `lazy_contiguous_utf8` backing via identity take_positions, since a from_values Utf8 key is Eager and would otherwise skip this path): sum/mean/max/min vs pandas 2.2.3, all EXACT (raw f64 bit compare, incl. an all-missing category). fp-frame 3109/0, fp-conformance 418/1 (pre-existing where/mask only).

bench 2M rows, ~1000 categories, nullable Int64 (20%-null) value, CONTIGUOUS Utf8 key, best-of-6, pandas 2.2.3:

| `sgb.max`  Utf8-key nullable | 130ms | 60.2ms | 0.63x -> 1.37x WIN (pandas 82.6ms) |

FLIPS LOSS->WIN for the contiguous-Utf8-key case (CSV/parquet-loaded categoricals — the shape the all-valid Utf8-contiguous path already targets). REMAINING GAP: an EAGER Utf8 key (in-memory from_values) has `as_utf8_contiguous()==None` so agg_numeric skips ALL its Utf8 dense paths (all-valid AND this nullable one) and uses build_groups — the real fix there is a scalar-backed-Utf8-key dense path in agg_numeric (dense_group_ids has one; agg_numeric doesn't), a separate bigger lever for BOTH all-valid and nullable values. Also sparse/wide-i64-key nullable still generic (same template, not yet added).

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy sum/mean/max/min NULLABLE value + sparse/wide-i64 key: typed FxHashMap<i64> skipna bucket (LOSS -> 1.6-2.1x WIN)
Closes the "sparse/wide-i64-key nullable still generic" gap flagged in the prior (contiguous-Utf8) entry. agg_numeric's sparse/wide-i64 path groups via `FxHashMap<i64,gid>` over the raw `&[i64]` key slice (inline keys, no Scalar/SipHash) but gated its value bucket on `as_f64_slice`/`as_i64_slice` (all-valid) — so a NULLABLE value column keyed by a wide i64 key fell through to generic build_groups (per-row Scalar `.values()` + ScalarKey + SipHash), ~2.6x slower than the typed grouping. Added the sister nullable arm: reuse the SAME `FxHashMap<i64,gid>` inline-key grouping, bucket only PRESENT values (skipna), emit `Null(NaN)` for an all-missing group else `Float64(func(nums))`. Character-for-character mirror of the already-verified bounded-Int64 nullable branch (differs only in FxHashMap grouping vs dense array + `Int64(k)` label) — bit-identical by construction. VERIFIED bit-exact vs pandas 2.2.3 on a sparse-key differential (8000 rows, card 500, key *1_000_003 to force the sparse arm, ~fully-missing group 4 + 25% null): sum/mean/max/min all EXACT.

bench 2M rows, sparse i64 key (card 200k, *1_000_003), nullable Int64 (20%-null) value, best-of-6, quiet box, pandas 2.2.3:

| `sgb.max`  sparse-i64 nullable | 671ms | 192.5ms | ~0.45x -> 1.56x WIN (pandas 300ms) |

FLIPS LOSS->WIN. The typed FxHashMap<i64,gid> grouping (already used for all-valid sparse-i64 values) was the missing rung for the nullable value case — same template as the bounded-Int64 and contiguous-Utf8 nullable branches. REMAINING: an EAGER Utf8 key nullable value still uses build_groups (needs a scalar-Utf8-key dense path in agg_numeric — separate lever, covers all-valid too).

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy.count NULLABLE value + Int64/Utf8 key: typed present-count (LOSS -> 1.8-3.1x WIN)
count()'s dense/typed fast paths all gate on `!has_any_missing()` (all-valid value ⇒ count == group size). A NULLABLE value column fell to the generic build_groups tail (SipHash + per-row Scalar `.values()[idx].is_missing()`) — 0.47x pandas for a bounded-Int64 key, collapsing to 0.16x for a sparse/wide-Int64 key (SipHash-dominated). Added a nullable-value handler ahead of the tail: precompute a `present` mask once off the raw validity (`as_i64_slice_with_validity` ⇒ `validity.get(i)`; `as_f64_slice_with_validity` ⇒ `validity.get(i) && !is_nan`, since a valid-but-NaN Float64 slot is `is_missing()`), then group via the same typed key structures the all-valid paths use — bounded-Int64 dense table, sparse-Int64 FxHashMap<i64,gid>, contiguous-Utf8 FxHashMap<&[u8],gid> — creating a gid on first-seen KEY (pandas keeps an all-missing group ⇒ count 0) and adding `present[i]` per row. Bit-identical: VERIFIED vs pandas 2.2.3 on a differential (9000 rows, bounded card 37 + sparse card 600 *1_000_003, group-4 fully-missing value + 25% null), bounded AND sparse counts all EXACT incl. the count-0 group.

| `sgb.count` sparse-i64 key  | 605.8ms | 52.9ms | 0.16x -> 1.82x WIN (pandas 96.1ms) |

FLIPS LOSS->WIN. count was a SEPARATE path from agg_numeric (counts non-missing per group, not a reduction) — this closes the documented `sgb.count nullable-i64 0.44x` gap plus the far worse sparse-i64 case. Same template family as the agg_numeric nullable branches (bounded/sparse-i64 + contiguous-Utf8). REMAINING: EAGER Utf8 key (in-memory, as_utf8_contiguous==None) nullable value still build_groups.

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — SeriesGroupBy sum/mean/max/min/count on EAGER (in-memory) Utf8 key: dense_group_ids path (LOSS -> 1.0-3.7x WIN)
Closes the LAST agg_numeric/count nullable gap (the "EAGER Utf8 key still generic" residual from the two prior entries). agg_numeric's dense paths gate the KEY on `as_i64_slice`/`as_utf8_contiguous`, so an in-memory `from_values` Utf8 key (`as_utf8_contiguous()==None`, unlike a CSV/parquet-loaded contiguous key) fell to generic build_groups (SipHash) for BOTH all-valid and nullable values (~0.63x pandas). Added an agg_numeric path reusing the shared `dense_group_ids` gid layout — which ALREADY handles the scalar-backed Utf8 key (fp-frame:30765) — plus `dense_group_labels`: bucket per gid in ascending row order (typed all-valid slice, or validity-masked nullable skipna with `!is_nan` for valid-but-NaN f64), `Null(NaN)` for an all-missing group, only for a numeric value backing. Mirror fix in count() (present-count via the same dense_group_ids fallback after its contiguous-Utf8 arm). Bit-identical: dense_group_ids assigns gids in the same first-seen order as build_groups. VERIFIED vs pandas 2.2.3 on an eager-Utf8 differential (7000 rows, card 40, group-4 fully-missing + 25% null): sum/mean/max/min/count all EXACT. fp-frame 3109/0.

FLIPS LOSS->WIN. This was the "bigger lever" flagged in the prior two entries — one dense_group_ids-keyed bucket path in agg_numeric covers all 4 reducers × {all-valid, nullable} for the eager-Utf8 key; the all-valid case (3.4-3.7x) benefits most since it never even had a typed eager-Utf8 path. SeriesGroupBy nullable-value surface (bounded/sparse-i64 + contiguous/eager-Utf8 keys) now fully WIN across sum/mean/max/min/count.

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — DataFrameGroupBy sum/mean/max/min/std/count on Utf8 key + NULLABLE Float64 values: str-dense gate relaxation (LOSS -> 1.9x WIN)
DataFrameGroupBy's str-dense bypass (both the native-contiguous-Utf8 and eager/from_values-Utf8 key paths in aggregate_named_func) gated every value column on `as_f64_slice() || as_i64_slice()` (all-valid ONLY), so a frame with ANY nullable value column keyed by a Utf8 column fell to the generic build_groups path (~0.56x pandas — the common `df.groupby("cat").sum()` idiom on real, null-bearing data). The int64-key dense path already accepted `as_f64_slice_with_validity()` (nullable Float64) and the shared `dense_aggregate_emit` already has the skipna branch for it — the str-dense gates simply hadn't been widened. Added `|| col.as_f64_slice_with_validity().is_some()` to both str-dense gates. Zero emit change — reuses the tested nullable-Float64 skipna branch. Bit-identical: VERIFIED vs pandas 2.2.3 on an eager-Utf8-key differential (6000 rows, card 30, 2 nullable-f64 cols incl. a fully-missing group) — sum/mean/max/min/count/std all EXACT (default sum: all-missing group -> 0.0, matching pandas). fp-frame 3109/0.

FLIPS LOSS->WIN. bounded-Int64 key + nullable-Float64 was ALREADY fast (18ms, the int64-dense path handles nullable-f64); this closes the Utf8-key sibling. REMAINING: nullable-Int64 value columns still fall to generic on ALL dense paths (dense_aggregate_emit has no as_i64_slice_with_validity branch, and the gates exclude it) — a follow-up needing an emit branch + the Int64-sum output-dtype question (Int64 vs Float64 vs the generic path).

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — DataFrameGroupBy.count with NULLABLE numeric value columns: per-column present-count (LOSS -> 2.2-2.9x WIN)
try_count_dense bailed on `!value_cols.iter().all(|c| !c.has_nulls())` — ANY nullable value column sent the whole `df.groupby(k).count()` to the generic build_groups path (bounded-Int64 key 0.37x pandas, eager-Utf8 key 0.57x). count is Int64-valued (no output-dtype question, unlike sum), so it's the cleanest nullable dfgb lever. Relaxed the gate to admit nullable NUMERIC columns (`as_i64_slice_with_validity` / `as_f64_slice_with_validity`; a nullable non-numeric col like Utf8/Bool still bails), then compute a PER-COLUMN count off the dense grouping try_count_dense already builds: all-valid col ⇒ group size (shared vec, as before); nullable ⇒ tally present per group (`validity.get` for Int64; `validity.get && !is_nan` for Float64, matching the generic per-row `!is_missing()`). Bit-identical: VERIFIED vs pandas 2.2.3 on bounded-Int64 AND eager-Utf8 key differentials (6000 rows, card 30, mixed nullable-Int64 + nullable-Float64 cols, group-4 fully-missing) — all 30 per-key counts EXACT both columns both keys. fp-frame 3109/0.

FLIPS LOSS->WIN. Complements the str-dense sum/mean nullable-f64 fix (prior entry). REMAINING dfgb nullable gap: sum/mean/etc. on nullable-INT64 value columns (dense_aggregate_emit has no as_i64_slice_with_validity branch; needs the Int64-sum output-dtype decision).

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — DataFrameGroupBy sum/mean/max/min/var/std/prod/median/first/last on NULLABLE Int64 value columns: dedicated skipna emit branch (LOSS -> 1.6-4.4x WIN)
Completes the dfgb nullable-value surface. dense_aggregate_emit had branches for all-valid-f64 / all-valid-i64 / nullable-f64, but NONE for nullable-Int64, and all three dense gates (contiguous-Utf8, eager-Utf8, bounded-Int64 key) excluded `as_i64_slice_with_validity` — so a frame with ANY nullable-Int64 value column fell entirely to generic build_groups (~0.6-0.67x pandas; blocks even sibling nullable-f64 cols via the all-columns gate). Added a nullable-Int64 skipna emit branch + widened the three gates. CRITICAL dtype subtlety: the branch mirrors the GENERIC (build_groups) path's per-func output dtype, which DIFFERS from the all-valid-Int64 branch — notably `prod` is Float64 for null-bearing Int64 (generic coerces) but Int64 for all-valid. Verified by capturing the generic path's exact per-func dtype/empty-group output BEFORE the change, then confirming the new dense path reproduces it BIT-IDENTICALLY (sum Int64 empty->0, mean/var/std/median/prod Float64, min/max/first/last Int64 empty->Null(NaN), median empty->Null(NaN) via is_nan guard). Also 644 checks vs pandas 2.2.3 (bounded + eager keys, 11 funcs, fully-missing group) all EXACT. fp-frame 3109/0.

DataFrameGroupBy nullable-value surface (sum/mean/max/min/var/std/prod/median/first/last/count × {bounded-Int64, contiguous/eager-Utf8} keys × {nullable Int64, nullable Float64} values) now fully WIN. LESSON: nullable-Int64 groupby output dtype follows the GENERIC path, not the all-valid dense arm (prod Int64->Float64 divergence) — always capture the generic per-func dtype first.

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — DataFrameGroupBy MULTI-key (>=2 Int64 keys) sum/mean/count/var/std on NULLABLE (or all-valid Int64) values: route through dense emit (LOSS -> 3.9x WIN)
Multi-key sum/mean/count/var/std went through `agg_typed_pairs_dense_f64_moments`, gated on ALL value columns being all-valid Float64 — so an all-valid-Int64 OR any nullable value column bailed to generic build_groups (~0.6x pandas). The sibling multi-key arm (`aggregate_multi_int64_dense` -> multi_int64_dense_grouping + the shared dense_aggregate_emit, which now has typed AND nullable-skipna branches) only listed min/max/first/last/prod/median. Widened it to ALSO cover sum/mean/count/var/std and admit nullable value columns (as_f64/i64_slice_with_validity). The all-Float64 moments engine still takes all-valid-f64 sum/mean/count/var/std FIRST (unchanged); this arm now catches the Int64/nullable cases it declined. Bit-identical: dense_aggregate_emit matches the generic path (verified single-key), multi_int64_dense_grouping matches build_groups' composite-key order (the min/max arm already relies on it). VERIFIED 540 checks vs pandas 2.2.3 (2 Int64 keys, nullable-Float64 + nullable-Int64 cols, 9 funcs) all EXACT. fp-frame 3109/0.

bench 2M rows, 2 Int64 keys (~2000 groups), mixed nullable Float64 + Int64 value cols, best-of-6, pandas 2.2.3:
| op | before (generic) | after | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `dfgb.sum`  multi-Int64 key | 157.6ms | 24.8ms | 0.62x -> 3.94x WIN (pandas 97.7ms) |
| `dfgb.mean` multi-Int64 key | 165.9ms | 25.4ms | 0.60x -> 3.93x WIN (pandas 99.8ms) |

FLIPS LOSS->WIN. Extends the single-key nullable dfgb wins to the multi-key case. DataFrameGroupBy nullable-value surface (single AND multi Int64/Utf8 keys × nullable Int64/Float64 values × all reducers) now fully WIN.

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — Series.duplicated on WIDE/high-cardinality Int64: custom open-addressing i64 hash set (LOSS -> 1.73x WIN)
duplicated_flags_i64_direct required a BOUNDED-range dense histogram; a wide/high-cardinality Int64 column (range too large for the direct-address table) returned None and fell to the generic `.values()` + ScalarKey + SipHash path — 0.29x pandas (204ms vs 60ms), the classic khash floor. Two-step fix: (1) route wide-range Int64 through the existing typed `duplicated_flags_over_i64` (was FxHashSet<i64>, used by the Datetime64 wide-span path) instead of bailing — got to 80ms/0.75x, still a loss (FxHashSet loses to khash); (2) replace its First/Last arms with a custom open-addressing i64 hash set (khash-style: power-of-two table, linear probing, splitmix64 hash, inline i64 slots + occupied byte-map, load factor <=0.75) — one contiguous alloc, no per-op modulo, cache-friendly probe. 204ms -> 34.9ms. Bit-identical (VERIFIED vs pandas 2.2.3 duplicated(keep='first') on 20k wide-i64, EXACT; Last symmetric, None unchanged on FxHashSet). fp-frame 3109/0.

bench 2M rows, wide-i64 (~1M distinct, *7919), best-of-5, pandas 2.2.3:
| op | before (Scalar) | +FxHashSet | +open-addr | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `Series.duplicated` wide-i64 | 204.7ms | 80.5ms | 34.9ms | 0.29x -> 1.73x WIN (pandas 60.3ms) |

FLIPS LOSS->WIN. The open-addressing i64 table is the "custom open-addr i64 table UNTRIED" lever from the khash-floor notes — it beats FxHashSet<i64> by ~2.3x here. Shared via duplicated_flags_over_i64 so drop_duplicates(keep=first/last) inherit it. REMAINING khash-floor siblings still on FxHashMap: value_counts wide-i64 0.41x, unique/nunique wide-i64 0.73x (candidate for the same open-addr table adapted to counting / first-seen collection).

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — Series.unique / nunique on WIDE/high-cardinality Int64: open-addressing i64 set (LOSS -> 1.4-1.6x WIN)
Sibling of the duplicated wide-i64 fix (prior entry). unique() and nunique() had typed wide-range Int64 fast paths but on `FxHashSet<i64>`, which loses to pandas' khash on wide/high-cardinality data (unique 0.73x, nunique 0.74x). Added `Self::oa_distinct_i64(data, collect)` — the same custom open-addressing i64 table as oa_dup_flags_i64 (power-of-two, linear probe, splitmix64, inline slots + occupied byte-map, load factor <=0.75), returning the distinct count and (for unique) the first-seen distinct values. Swapped both FxHashSet sites for it. Bit-identical: VERIFIED vs pandas 2.2.3 on 30k wide-i64 — unique() first-seen ORDER exactly matches pandas.unique(), nunique() count EXACT. fp-frame 3109/0.

bench 2M rows, wide-i64 (~1M distinct, *7919), best-of-5, pandas 2.2.3:
| op | before (FxHashSet) | after (open-addr) | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `Series.nunique` wide-i64 | 72.0ms | 32.8ms | 0.74x -> 1.63x WIN (pandas 53.4ms) |
| `Series.unique`  wide-i64 | 76.0ms | 39.8ms | 0.73x -> 1.40x WIN (pandas 55.8ms) |

FLIPS LOSS->WIN. Extends the open-addressing lever to the distinct-collection ops. REMAINING khash-floor sibling: value_counts wide-i64 0.41x (needs the table + a per-key count payload + first-seen-order emit) — the last and biggest of the wide-i64 hash losses.

### 2026-07-02 BlackThrush — Series.isin on WIDE/high-cardinality all-Int64 needles: open-addressing i64 membership (LOSS -> 1.43x WIN)
isin's dense-bitset fast path (`int_needle_membership_bitset`) only fires for a BOUNDED needle span; a wide/high-cardinality all-Int64 needle set (ids, hashes) returned None and dropped the column to the generic `IsinIndex` SipHash HashSet + `Vec<Scalar::Bool>` output — 0.37x pandas (84ms vs 31ms), the isin khash floor. Added a wide-Int64 path with the SAME all-Int64-needle gate as the bitset: build the needle set in the custom open-addressing i64 table (`Self::oa_i64_isin_flags` — power-of-two, linear probe, splitmix64, inline slots + occupied byte-map) and probe the raw `&[i64]` haystack, emitting typed Bool (1B/elem). Bit-identical to pure-i64 set membership (`IsinIndex::contains(Int64)` == `ints.contains`, the same equivalence the bitset path relies on). VERIFIED vs pandas 2.2.3 on 50k haystack / 5k wide-i64 needles — EXACT. fp-frame 3109/0.

bench 2M-row haystack, 100k wide-i64 needles, best-of-5, quiet box, pandas 2.2.3:
| op | before (IsinIndex) | after (open-addr) | vs pandas 2.2.3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `Series.isin` wide-i64 | 83.7ms | 20.6ms | 0.37x -> 1.43x WIN (pandas 29.5ms) |

FLIPS LOSS->WIN. Fifth reuse of the open-addressing i64 table (after duplicated / unique / nunique) — the build-then-probe membership variant. searchsorted wide-i64 already WINS 3.84x (finger-search). REMAINING wide-i64 hash floor: value_counts 0.76x (bottlenecked on Index::new(1M labels), not the tally — needs an fp-index lazy result-index lever, surfaced separately).
